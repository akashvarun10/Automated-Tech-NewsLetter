      "[Document(page_content='(cube bounces) (electronic crackling) - Budget phones are fun, because, pretty much with all of them, if you poke around hard enough, you will find the thing that\\nthey had to cut corners on, you\\'ll find the thing\\nthat they trimmed back to get it to be a budget phone. And so for picking one for\\nyou, it\\'s just a matter of picking the one that\\nmakes the trade offs that you\\'re okay with. Like maybe you love, you gotta have good build\\nquality and cameras. Well then, iPhone SE is\\nprobably a good one for you. And then you know you\\'re\\nnot gonna get a great screen or battery life or things like that. Or maybe you gotta have\\na great big screen. Samsung makes the Galaxy A54. Ar maybe you gotta have\\ngood software and cameras. Pixel 7A. This phone is 350 bucks. And this, this is the designer one. (sophisticated electro-jazz music) (electronic crackling) So, this phone is not\\ngoing to win anyone over with raw specs. It\\'s not gonna win by\\nhaving the best camera or the best battery life\\nof any budget phone. The performance isn\\'t gonna\\nblow you outta the water, but you could definitely argue that it\\'s the prettiest $350 phone. So Nothing has had this\\ntransparent aesthetic going for a while with their phones, and then also the earbuds. This one definitely also has that. There\\'s also a white version of this. I think it looks better, it\\nalso has like black buttons, so it\\'s kinda this nice contrast, but, you know, dark\\nversion looks cool too. And honestly if the mission is\\nto look like a Nothing phone, and not be mistaken for anything else, then, yeah, mission\\ndefinitely accomplished. The dual cameras in the\\nmiddle and near the top is pretty unique. Kinda like a pair of eyes maybe. And the NFC coil actually\\nsurrounds the cameras. Then there are three bars of\\nLEDs making a glyph design around the camera circle again. Then it\\'s kinda this split design, the bottom half is like\\na PCB-inspired look, apparently inspired by the\\nNew York City subway map. And Nothing\\'s already shown people this, like there\\'s been some\\nreactions to the design already. Some people love it, some\\npeople actually hate it. I don\\'t know, it\\'s a bit asymmetrical, so it\\'s unconventional for\\nsure, but I think it\\'s nice, not gonna lie. But even if you don\\'t like\\nit, at least you can say it\\'s at least somewhat\\nvisually interesting. You know, there\\'s some textures,\\nthere\\'s some exposed screws and some text and that little red square, it\\'s not functional, it\\'s\\njust purely to look cool, so, I appreciate that. And if you do like this look but have maybe a more boring phone that you\\'re not willing to give up, then channel sponsor dbrand has you covered with\\ntheir Something skins. So if you haven\\'t heard of it already, dbrand has performed some, and these are their words, not mine, \"Creative plagiarism\" on\\nNothing\\'s whole design language, both in light mode and dark mode, so I\\'ll leave a link below\\nif you wanna check those out. But guess what? It\\'s an extremely\\ncompetitive price bracket, so you get a good looking phone, but you still will have to\\nmake some sacrifices to get it. So first of all, it\\'s clear\\nplastic, not glass, at the back. Which, you know, I\\'m sure Zach will get to\\nthis phone at some point, but I think it\\'ll be easier\\nto scuff and scratch, but harder to shatter,\\nlike glass would be, so, but I think it\\'s a\\nreasonable trade off. It\\'s also a textured\\nplastic frame as well, so it looks like aluminum, but it\\'s this plastic all\\nthe way around the phone, to the point where this phone\\nactually ends up feeling surprisingly light in the\\nhand for how big it is. But we should just get to that, this is a huge, it\\'s a\\njumbo-sized phone, it\\'s gigantic. Some people might not love that, but I think a lotta people\\nlike really big screens, and you get the natural advantages that come with a big phone, which is a big battery and a big screen. So this is a relatively\\ngiant 6.7-inch display corner to corner. It\\'s literally ultra phone size. And it gets pretty bright too, so definitely not flagship bright, \\'cause we have some\\ncrazy numbers these days, but 1300 knits peak brightness is very visible in bright indoor lighting, and bezels are even all the way around the front of the phone, so, aesthetically, I have no complaints. And then even at this price, it\\'s AMOLED, it has an optical fingerprint\\nreader under the glass. Its variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz. And it even has 2160 hertz PWM dimming. So if you don\\'t like\\nthe back of this phone, at least the front of it, that you\\'re actually\\nlooking at all the time, is pretty impressive for 350 bucks. But I\\'d say an even bigger\\nstrength to this phone is battery life. So battery always comes from\\nthree main things, basically, obviously having a huge physical battery. Also good software and an efficient chip. We\\'ll get to the software. But, this phone has a\\n5000-milliamp hour battery, that\\'s literally bigger than their flagship phones from Nothing, so, really big battery. It doesn\\'t have wireless charging, but it does have 45-watt wire charging. Which is pretty good, that\\'s\\nzero to full in an hour. And the chip it\\'s running\\nis this little thing called the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro. So, this was my biggest\\nquestion mark, actually, going into testing this phone, \\'cause, you know how Nothing teases the specs and stuff ahead of time. So we find out it\\'s a MediaTek chip, and I\\'m not sure if this\\none\\'s going to perform the way I\\'ve been used\\nto some other phones, like they\\'re showcasing\\nall these, you know, specifically handpicked\\nbenchmarks results, of course they will, but\\nconveniently, they only compare it to a two-year-old Nothing Phone 1 which had that mid-range,\\n778G Plus from Qualcomm. Now, I\\'m not expecting\\nflagship stuff for 350 bucks, but like, what\\'s it gonna land at, this feels like a make or\\nbreak part of the phone. And I\\'ve been pleasantly surprised. Now, it\\'s not gonna win\\nany prizes with raw specs, and I definitely don\\'t think\\nit\\'ll earn anybody\\'s money with the benchmark scores alone, you look at those numbers, you\\'re like \"Okay, not\\na total shock here.\" But as far as actual performance,\\nwhen you use the phone, the way I\\'d put it is, it\\'s respectable, and I really feel like that is\\na testament to the software, and how well it\\'s working together. So, at this point we\\'re on Nothing OS 2.5, on top of Android 14. And you already have seen\\nNothing Phone software with the dots and the\\naesthetic and all that stuff, but, it\\'s clean, there\\'s no bloat wear, and there is a solid\\nfocus on fast and smooth, it kinda feels like a throwback to the old OnePlus Magic back in the day. But with regular use, this phone\\nis quite smooth and snappy. Sometimes a fingerprint\\nreader shudders a little bit, like when you\\'re first unlocking, but for the most part, if you\\'re just using the phone\\ndoing stuff like messaging or flipping through a couple\\napps, email, web browsing, taking your pictures,\\nthis is a smooth phone. It\\'s pretty similar to what they did with the Nothing Phone 1, with this 778. It\\'s very solid with everyday use, and the second you try to\\ndo super high-end stuff, like gaming, then you\\'ll see where the\\nbenchmarks come up short, where you start dropping\\nframes and all that. But, again, this is a $350 phone and I am definitely not\\ncomplaining about that. Now Nothing has had some time now to build up their aesthetic\\nand their identity and what they really want\\na Nothing phone to be. And I gotta say, they\\nhave a lot of unique, really identifiable things going on here that you may like or dislike,\\nbut they\\'re all here. So aesthetically they\\'ve\\ngot the dots everywhere. So the stock apps have\\nthis dots aesthetic, and the thin font to go with it. The back arrow in Android\\nis made of these dots. And they have this extensive\\nbuilt-out selection of Nothing widgets now, most of them with the dots theme as well, so you can have this very\\nconsistent home screen aesthetic. And then there\\'s other little stuff, like you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up four spots on your home screen for a unique home screen grid. I don\\'t know, you might be into that. There\\'s also this nice little animation with the folders on the home screen. Also this new thing which\\nlets you add a glass effect to your wallpaper, so it\\'s blurred behind your home screen for better visibility, I\\nactually really like that. There\\'s also AI wallpapers now, so you can jump into the wallpaper studio and create the most soulless combo art the world has ever seen\\nin just a few taps. There\\'s also third-party icon pack support on the home screen, with\\ninstant one-touch previews. And then of course the glyphs. So, this phone still has\\nsome lights on the back, it\\'s less lights that the\\nflagship, than the phone two, but, about the same\\namount of functionality. So there\\'s one vertical\\nlight on the right, and a small one down\\nhere on the bottom left, and then the big top one\\narcing around the top left. This is the one that works\\nwith the glyph countdown timer. Maybe you\\'ll find that useful. The blinking notification\\nglyph when your phone is down, I still wish I could just\\ncustomize it a little bit more, I know they don\\'t wanna do\\nRGB, but if this was RGB, I would totally have different colors light up for different app notifications and I would go to town\\nwith that, but, you know, it still works with just white lights. And it also does music visualizations to sync up with any music\\ncoming out of the speaker, so... (phone plays electro-R&B music) I don\\'t know. Sure. Obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks. Some of this you may find\\nuseful like once or twice, I almost never use the countdown clock, but the one time I use\\nit, it\\'s kinda cool. Side note, I couldn\\'t\\nget the glyph composer to work at all on this phone. The UI worked, but it didn\\'t light up\\nthe lights on the back. But you know, on super closeup photos, maybe the glyph fill flash\\nis decently useful sometimes, useless other times. But hey, while we\\'re on\\nthe subject, the camera. The cameras on the back\\nhere are serviceable, like, it\\'s just practical to have cameras on the back of your phone, and these, they\\'re not\\ngood, but, they\\'re fine. I always feel like we go\\ninto budget phone reviews kinda knowing, okay, this isn\\'t gonna have\\ncameras that blow me away, it\\'s not gonna be as\\ninteresting to test these, but, you gotta test \\'em anyway\\nand see what they\\'re made of, so, this has a different new 50-megapixel primary\\ncamera on the back, and then it has the same ultra-wide camera as the Nothing phone too, and actually also the same selfie camera. And look, it can take okay pictures. Alright, passable pictures. I know 50 megapixels is a big number, but, here\\'s what I\\'ll say: at this level, even in great lighting, the photos aren\\'t particularly sharp. The dynamic range or depth\\nof field aren\\'t amazing. Like, you\\'re not buying this phone to take the greatest most\\nartistic photos and videos the world has ever seen. But, what you do need is\\nfor it to be serviceable, to be quick enough for autofocus to work, for it to capture a moment,\\ndocument scanning, video calls, sharing photos with people. And it does all that,\\nand it\\'s totally fine, and I can\\'t complain. And really what\\'s left a\\nbigger imprint on me using this is that, compared to their\\nother flagship phones, almost all of the features are still here. Like the only one I\\'m not actually seeing on this budget version of\\nthe phone is macro mode. And that, that theme of\\nkeeping a lotta the stuff from the more expensive phones and not doing these artificial cuts, that\\'s what feels good about\\nthis phone as a budget phone, to me, it actually feels like\\nthey\\'re trying to give people all of the Nothing phone\\nexperience for less money. Now, we definitely can\\'t\\nsay it\\'s one-to-one, there\\'s obviously cuts,\\nespecially with hardware, Like there\\'s no wireless\\ncharging, like I said. It\\'s IP54 instead of IP68. It\\'s plastic instead\\nof glass and aluminum. But, I like that once you\\nstart to get to use the phone, especially with the software\\nfeatures, experience wise, I don\\'t feel nearly as many\\nartificial-feeling cuts as we\\'ve seen on other phones. Like there\\'s no pro mode in the camera that\\'s missing from the budget phone. All the same advanced settings,\\nthe experimental features, all the home screen\\nfeatures with Nothing OS, it\\'s all here, on this cheaper phone. And the crazy part to me is, they obviously wanna compare\\nthis to a lower-end phone, so they compare it to the Phone 1, and my natural instinct is\\nlike, \"I\\'m ignoring that, \"of course they\\'re comparing\\nit to the old phone.\" But when, you actually look\\nat that 2-year-old phone, you kinda see how far they\\'ve come. And you look at the things that are actually better\\nabout this budget phone. This Nothing Phone 2A has\\na bigger, brighter screen, with thinner bezels. It has a larger battery,\\nwith faster charging, a higher-processor clock speed, a higher-resolution front camera, and a wider variety of refresh\\nrates than the Phone 1. Like, no wonder they\\nwanna show us the Phone 1. But, in general, if you\\'re\\nlooking for the TLDW, yes, this is a good, solid,\\nall-around budget phone. And the way Nothing has\\nbeen tracking with software, it appears, I mean they\\'re promising three years of Android\\nupdates with this phone. I think this will be a\\ngood budget phone to own for the next couple years. Well done, Nothing. Well done. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one.

      "[Document(page_content=\"down down down down Samsung Galaxy S one of the most popular names in the world of smartphones and has been for years interestingly it's kind of a long name you might be wondering where Galaxy s comes from and if you think you already know what you're thinking is probably wrong apparently Galaxy comes from a wine often enjoyed by highlevel Samsung Executives and then they proceeded to name like 20,000 phones after it now here's the thing Samsung will try anything that's kind of their thing like this is something I've known about them for a long time from reviewing their phones but just from researching for this video like they have a ton of phones in every single imaginable price bracket or feature set or spec sheet here you can even try to guess these they've had a Samsung Galaxy F series what do you think the F stands for stands for fun then there's the Galaxy Z series Z for zero and Galaxy m is you'd think midrange but it actually stands for Millennial and then Galaxy a that's some of their most popular affordable smartphones so naturally it stands for Alpha there's galaxy W for Wonder Galaxy R for Royal the list goes on but then the flagship that's lived at the top of their lineup is the Samsung Galaxy S and S stands for super smart yeah super smart anyway the first ever Samsung Galaxy S comes out in 2010 just to set the scene like this is 3 years after the first ever iPhones come out so the iPhone 4 is about to come out this is a couple months after the Nexus 1 gets unveiled Blackberry is quicking in their boots like the entire smartphone industry if you want to call it that is totally in a reshuffling things are up for for grabs and it's still very much in its infancy too the second most popular phone selling by volume looks like this it's a Nokia 3720 classic and so Samsung launches the first ever Galaxy S super smart into the world with over two dozen variations this is going to be a bit of a theme here you know it a pretty basic phone big touchcreen on the front some capacitive buttons a plastic removable back a single camera today we have Samsung Galaxy s24 and it's Ultra refined tightly packed supercomputer in the palm of your hands with high resolution cameras and displays powerful processors AI features like just a ton of optimizations that have stacked up over the years to get to this point so today I've got every single Samsung Galaxy S that has ever been released they're all in front of me actually it's every main Galaxy S variant from the S1 to the s24 everything in between and I'm going to review them all and some of them I've reviewed before and others are like the first time I've ever gotten them working on camera but either way it'll be fun to go back and go through this is the story of how we got to where we are today and where it started so buckle up we're going to Jump Right In also stay tuned for the graphs at the end like usual they're super fun so Samsung Galaxy S this is the first one summer 2010 and yeah it does clearly look old with the classic four capactive buttons at the bottom Android .1 and it's a micro USB port at the top next to the headphone jack but I feel like right off the bat you can see Samsung differentiating itself here first of all this is a reasonable display this is a 4-in screen and it's a Samsung made AMOLED display so that's a huge deal back in these days you could see a meaningful difference in battery life just if you set a wallpaper with a bunch of black in it because the pixels didn't have to light up on the OLED and that was A New Concept back then it's also only a 1500 mAh battery so every bit of savings you can get means a lot also of course this was back in the day when you could just pop the back off any phone and just take the battery out swap it out at any moment have two batteries if you want to swap them in and out real quick while the others are charging we will witness the death of this feature during this video but then using this phone now like okay it feels slow obviously but it's not really in the laggy or unresponsive way it's just slow like there's a lot of solid waiting for anything to happen especially heavier stuff like the web browser or opening the camera you just have to slow down a little bit give it a second even though this launched with what at the time was the fastest Graphics processing of any smartphone thanks to a Samsung made chip inside oh and speaking of cameras it launched with a single 5 megapixel camera on the back which was capable of shooting actually 720p video right out the box it asks for a memory card to do a lot of things like shooting videos because it only comes with two or 4 gigs of storage out the box but there's a Micro SD card expandable storage slot in the back of the phone so you can go right up to 32 gigs right off the bat so I never used one of these phones but my favorite thing about it now is it it's kind of got the modern shape already it has like kind of flat sides and a flat back there is no camera bump uh there is a small bump in the plastic actually over the rear-facing speaker because it was common to put your phone down on a table or something and without that bump it would block the speaker and so that bump literally is just to keep the speaker open so you can always hear your sound now you remember how I was saying Samsung will kind of just try anything that's been true since the first one like this first ever Galaxy S launched with like I said over a dozen variants and so you might recognize this one as the Samsung Galaxy S Stratosphere and you can tell because this is the one with a little Verizon stamp on its forehead here but you might have had the Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant that's what it would be called if you got the variant that was made for T-Mobile or the Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G which is what they call the one that launched on Sprint now in hindsight honestly it feels like this was Samsung's way of just getting around carrier exclusives cuz they basically just made a slightly different version of this phone for every carrier in America with a little bit of a different design and a little bit of different features only Samsung only Samsung little did they know this would be the beginning of a whole empire so the sequel the first sequel is a Samsung Galaxy S2 second gen can teach you a lot so right away a couple things this phone is no notably bigger and noticeably sleeker than the first Galaxy S and these were back in the days where the percentage increases year-over-year with some of the stuff they did was crazy on paper like this went from a 1 GHz chip to a 1.2 GHz dual cord chip so that's just more than double the processing power it also went from a 4in screen to a 4.3in screen it goes from a 5 megapixel 720p camera to an 8 megap camera on the back shooting 1080p it doubled the ram up to a gbyte it bumped up to a 1,650 mAh battery and the amount of Base storage I guess you would say ouled from 2 gigs all the way up to 16 and it did all that in a phone that got thinner and it also added NFC so it added pieces and now this is an 8 and2 mm phone so this is one of the thinnest phones in the world at the time that it came out now the starting price also did go up a lot from $3.99 to $5.49 but this phone did launch into a relative success this sold like 3 million units in the first 2 months this was definitely the first one to show up on my radar I never owned one of these phones but I definitely saw it and thought about it but then this next one the Galaxy S3 in 2012 this is the first Samsung Galaxy S that I actually owned and I remember loving this thing I remember it well too the jump up and size again was very real so it's all the way up to a 4.8 in phone now which believe it or not like this is starting to push the limits of what people considered an appropriate phone size cuz I remember around this time there were a lot of phones that that were hitting exactly 4.65 in like that was a popular phone screen size for the big phones at the time and anything near 5 in kind of felt like weird like a tablet size and here's Samsung's flagship pushing 4.8 in of screen and then the four capacitor buttons down at the front are now just three buttons the search button's gone so it's a home button that's a physical button with back button on the right and menu on the left and this is also the first time we got a voice assistant on the phone and they called it SVO clever I know this is a a pretty direct response to we just got Siri announced on the iPhone the year before but you know S Voice s for Samsung they also use S for a bunch of other stuff S Notes so Samsung voice S Voice Now S Voice wasn't good but then again neither were any of the other voice assistants that were coming out so this is mostly just people poking around asking it to do things random facts just weather things like that what turned out to be much more significant with this phone is just this super sleek design the whole thing is shaped like a thin Pebble that you could probably skip across a lake it's inspired by Nature the whole OS leaned into that it had a ton of water droplet sounds everywhere the lock screen went from swipe to unlock to dragging your finger through this water like it was a pretty strong theme for them but I remember using this phone and reviewing it this is back in college for me I loved it it was also received very well and the combo of like being super slim and fast and having a huge OLED and S Voice had it starting to get touted like the iPhone killer um but I think more interestingly they thought this phone was big enough to Warrant an S3 Mini cuz this is a 4.8 in screen like I said kind of giant and so they came out with the one with a 4in display Galaxy S3 Mini at the same time cuz of course they did but the next year we got Samsung Galaxy S4 which was the beginning of a lot of things what do I feel like the fourth generation of any major new product is like the defining one this is this one's no exception now of course they're still making gigantic leaps on paper with specs cuz these little pocket computers are getting more and more capable of everything they do so it goes from a 4.8 in 720p screen to being one of the first phones with a 5 in 1080P screen in the age of a bunch of new retina displays that are aiming for the best pixel density then they also had variance all the way up from 1.4 to 1.9 GHz dual core processors it again doubled the Ram from 1 to 2 gb and that single back camera went from 8 megapixels to 13 megapixels so this is the first time you could take 1080p videos from the camera on the Galaxy S and then watch them on the 1080p screen on the front of the Galaxy S pretty sick this also goes from a 2,000 mAh battery to a 2600 mAh battery still removable uh a 30% increase is pretty crazy but again they just keep aiming for one day of battery life that's been a theme since this long ago like yes these things get more and more powerful every year and they're doing more and more stuff but as long as I can hit one day of battery life they seem cool with that now if you want more proof of Samsung just trying a ton of things this phone had a ton of random features some of them actually are kind of interesting cuz they feel like the the AI features of back in this day so like this is the phone that tried head tracking smart scrolling so when you're reading something you can tilt your head forward and backward to scroll through the page it's just insane it had smart rotation so this is actually cool if you have auto rotate on but you're looking at the screen while reading something and then turn sideways it won't rotate the screen it'll keep it right side up Smart Pause is fun you're watching a video you look away from the screen it'll automatically pause you look back it'll play again so there's lots of stuff like this some of it sticks some of it doesn't fine but this was also partially used to justify another increase in price for this phone so S4 at launch I don't know if you remember this it launched at $650 this is also the first time Samsung made an active version of the phone so another variant so Galaxy S4 Galaxy S4 Active so this added IP67 certification and a more rugged design it was a TFT LCD display instead of AMOLED and it traded some other small downgrades for like physical buttons and a slightly thicker phone with some flaps to cover the ports I'll tell you what was not really a major hit though this was one of the first major incidents of a Samsung phone battery swelling Catching Fire and burning up on someone now it didn't go happen to a ton of people it wasn't enough to become a major Trend but it's something to sort of remember for the future foreshadowing now by the time we get to Galaxy S5 Samsung is starting to hit their stride I think with the Galaxy S another huge battery bump now it's up to 2800 milliamp hours and another huge screen bump all the way up to 5.1 in diagonally and across the board this is uh I think fully Flagship in every dimens mention it's a it's a 2.7 GHz processor on some variants all right 2 to 3 gigs of RAM up to 32 gigs of storage and it's a 16 megapixel camera that now shoots 4K video also the bottom left button has gone from a menu button to a multitasking button to match the three primary buttons needed to operate Android but also says a lot about what it's capable of but then of course alongside all that is the absolute classic Samsung just trying things and I think the Telltale sign for this stuff like is when you see them try it for one generation just to throw it at the wall and see what sticks and then it's gone the next year like they added this little sensor back here next to the camera flash on the back that's a heart rate sensor so you could measure your heart rate plugs into S Health that didn't last very long they also added this weird texture for the first time to this plastic back that you know made it a little softer yes but also totally made it look like a Band-Aid plus it even came in this flesh color that also didn't stick around long they also added a fingerprint reader to the home button fun fact back in these days you actually had to swipe your whole finger across the home button to get it read of course fingerprint readers have stuck around but it doesn't have to be swiped anymore so that's improved significantly and you can see this weird port at the bottom here the Galaxy S5 has a sort of a double Port basically it could be used as just normal micro USB for charging but if you wanted full USB 3.0 data speeds there was a special like double-ended cable you could plug in to use all the pins and get that kind of weird that didn't stick around long either also there was a a flap on the bottom of all these phones for water resistance and they were super easy to fall off and this one also fell off naturally they also released both an active and a separate sport version of this phone alongside the regular Galaxy S5 of course they did so Samsung Galaxy S6 came out in 2015 but truthfully this was the beginning of a new era for Samsung phones you can look at it and see it this this is when they entered the modern age for better for worse so this phone was the first one with a fully glass back instead of plastic which yes made it their first non- removable back ke all the outrage in the comments of every YouTube video at the time but it also added uh wireless charging and they dropped these metal rails and metal buttons on the sides that felt way more solid than all the plastic we were working with on all the flagships that came before it and this phone is Sleek like footprint wise it's literally the same size as an iPhone 15 Pro from today but turn it sideways and it's one of the slimmest phones ever thanks to having a 2550 mAh battery yes that's actually smaller than the previous year now this is a recipe to make enthusiasts particularly mad when you go backwards it's not great so they heard that this went from a 2800 to a 2500 milliamp battery and it's not removable anymore and it also no longer has the micro SD card for expansion of your storage and on top of that you also went from that weird USB 3.0 thing down technically to USB 2.0 but aside from that this still did feel like their first really modern piece of Hardware this is also the first time we're getting a 1440p AMOLED display it's crazy sharp already we haven't seen a higher resolution since then and it's also the first Galaxy S Flagship with Optical image stabilization in the primary camera so this is a really big camera upgrade and it was the first Galaxy S Flagship to use 64-bit processing I do remember there was a lot of positive reception around this phone obviously from being well put together in metal and glass now and having good features and just generally being the same price as the previous year I just feel like there was one thing holding it back especially Among Us critical reviewers from being the obvious best Android phone available at that time and her name was TouchWiz see around this time there were also some other big Enthusiast Android options like Nexus 6p and 5x which were stock Android and then there was HT C1 M9 just down the street with their own HTC software LG G4 was out with their own software it's like every Android device scen at this time when it comes out it's like what are the specs what are the features what's the design and then what is the Android skin that you have to deal with to get it now Touchwiz has gotten better over time it's you know a little less bloop nature sounds but it's still absolutely a skin on top of Android rather than super integrated into Android itself which can make performance feel a little slow it can slow down how quickly updates come to this phone over time because they've got to go through Samsung but it gives you a bunch of extra features in return So at the time if you go back if you watch my videos around the phones at this time I always preferred like stock Android OEM just straight from Google it's always the fastest updates and it just felt the cleanest and most coherent where Samsung TouchWiz just had this this colorful cartoony look to it this feel to it it was a little cluttered but it it had the features it had What mattered anyway with S6 they also tried a little thing called the S6 Edge and Edge Plus because there was this war being fought at the time every time you saw a keynote with a new smartphone announcement they always mentioned screen to body ratios and so every Flagship if they can improve the best number they would always brag about the screen to body ratio how thin their bezels are and the best phones at the time were hovering around 70% meaning 70% of the front of the device is screen and the bigger that number the cooler the phone looks so this S6 Edge thing came along and it's another bit of Samsung Innovation just trying some stuff but they literally bend the OLED display right over to the edges of the phone and use curved glass to make it look like the display is like bleeding right over the edges of the device hence the edge name obviously there's still a bezel but it kind of worked it looked really cool uh this actually came at first from when when they originally tried it in the Galaxy Note which they had it on one side of the screen which is some like software tickers they literally put like a stock ticker on the side of the phone they would try anything to see if it worked and when it did they put it on both halves and now it's on the Galaxy S and it felt like the flagship thing so this phone got up to a 76% screen to body ratio with the S6 Edge Plus this is starting to feel like the top of a flagship lineup now Galaxy S7 was a kind of an incremental year in between you know holding it now you can tell they didn't really feel the need to change too much like it's the same size same screens and resolutions same storage sizes up to 128 gigs and they actually brought back expandable storage by popular demand so I guess you can talk Samsung into some stuff and you still can't take the back off this thing but they went ahead and added a Micro SD card slot on the SIM card tray which is clever but what I feel like they really realized this year is two things one wow you can really shove a lot of batteries in these things and two The Edge is the flagship people love the edge people just love the screen melting over the sides things so they're going to do a lot more of it so the regular S7 was great but the S7 Edge had a 3,000 mAh battery and the S7 Edge Plus had a 3600 mAh battery and then the S7 active had a 4,000 milliamp battery but for reference this is also the same year that the Galaxy Note 7 came out so you may recall the issues that plague the phone and its 3500 mAh battery the exact issue the reason why the note 7s started blowing up and having dangerous battery problems was specifically a design issue using a thin separator between two electrodes in a battery it was just damaged way too easily where wild reactions would occur when that damage happened for as many gates as we've had for smartphones like Ben gate whatever this has to be the greatest PR disaster in the history of smart phones like I think by a long way like people this got banned on planes like people would just ask do you have a Samsung phone like I don't think you want to take that on the plane it was literally recalled worldwide they took all of them back they couldn't sell it anymore it's a big issue and honestly a lot of tech companies would never recover from that but Samsung at this point was established enough they were big enough they were trying enough new things that they could weather that storm which is impressive then Samsung Galaxy S8 this is one of my favorite phones they added a lot of things to this phone now still classic Samsung thrown an absolute metric ton of stuff at the wall to see what sticks now I definitely didn't love all the stuff that they tried but I love that they were trying stuff and they tried so many things that these phones just feel a world apart so first of all there was an S8 and an S8 plus and both have fully curved Edge displays so Samsung's realized that this Advantage is received really really well and they can just keep touting their massive screen to body ratios plus they've refined their EDG screen apps feature it's subtle it's out of the way but it's useful for those who want to take advantage of it then they also tried this new pressure sensitive layer underneath the display right around the home button so the display can always respond to pressures in this area no matter where you are even while the screen is off now this is also as you may have guessed right around the time that Apple was trying 3D touch or Force touch in the iPhone and both of these didn't last very long but they tried and they also tried a slightly taller narrower 18 1 12 by9 aspect ratio which actually did nicely keep the ever growing screen size to be pretty reachable uh since they've also gone from capacitive buttons below the screen to all onscreen buttons so now talk about screen to body ratio like we are really cooking they also switched to USBC for the first time sick easy win people are asking for that last year anyway but then with that they also tried this thing called Dex which is like if you plug that USBC Port into a computer computer monitor you get this whole computer UI which just uses the phone as like a trackpad and then you might have noticed the extra button here on the left hand side so fun fact for the entire history of every single Samsung Galaxy S so far they have always had power button on the right hand side volume rocker on the left hand side and that's still true here but they've added a button underneath the volume rocker and yeah that's that's the Bixby button so Bixby is the new voice assistant replacing SVO on Samsung phones and Samsung really leaned in hard with this one so not only did it get a dedicated button to activate it all the time but the camera also now has Bixby Vision which is kind of like a an awkwardly specific competitor to Google lens and this is Samsung really leaning into the whole AI assistant thing for the first time and I would say to mixed success then they also tried a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone this time since there's no home button anymore love that and then they also tried this this plastic Snap-on keyboard which I think honestly might be in my top five worst smartphone accessories of all time but even after all of that I think the most important or the most impactful decision for this phone for Galaxy S8 was their choice to use Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in some regions and Samsung's own made exos chips in other regions now at the time or even in hindsight this was a pretty smart move maybe even ahead of their time because this is Samsung going all right we want to make our own chips for our phones so so that we can maximize the efficiencies and all the the power and the things that we do in our phones we want them to all be built by us and also to not give Qualcomm so much money while we're at it but also in hindsight this failed spectacularly this was like an ongoing thing they really wanted to do but because they didn't go all exos right from the get-go they split it they had some exos and some Snapdragon the Snapdragon phones would consistent L and regularly outperform the exos version of the same phone across the board better performance better efficiency better battery better heat it literally got to the point where prospective buyers would jump into subreddits and forums to try to find where they could import a Qualcomm version of the phone instead of the xnos one available in their own country and there are a whole bunch of tutorials on if you're buying a secondhand one how do you know which version you're getting just based on the serial number just so you can avoid the exos version like I said in hindsight ahead of their time a bit here but big backfire nevertheless there was lots of other stuff that was so new about this phone it Justified another increase in price all the way up to $750 that's today's prices so Galaxy S9 I'm going to say this was Peak Samsung Galaxy S I loved this galaxy S9 and again it was Galaxy S9 and S9 plus now this was a relatively incremental update versus S8 but you know slightly thinner bezels same Ram same storage but a slightly improved processor nice colors I like these colors and then they also moved that fingerprint sensor on the back from right next to the camera to right under the camera otherwise you know what basically the same thing but then they had to try some stuff so this time they tried this dual aperture thing with the camera and it was super cool basically it could snap between f1.5 wide open and f2.4 a variable aperture in a smartphone it's it's a clever little thing that would let you receive as much light as possible in low light situations but when you have plenty of light it would stop down to 2.4 and it would get more in focus it would be a sharper better looking photo and I remember I loved it when I used it other reviewers loved it when they used it and then it was gone from the next phone Samsung we missed this bring it back but honestly this is one of those phones picking it up now like I've talked about this before if you could bring back any old phone design from whatever year and just modernize it with new specs and new software I think between HTC1 M8 or M9 and this phone pretty good candidates this this thing is Sleek it's just a great size it's a 1440p OLED USB typc still has a headphone jack obviously the fingerprint reader is in a good spot just a really great overall package and I said as much in my original review back in 2018 now is it still Samsung software yeah but at this point there are so many features jammed in here that it's kind of undeniable the utility and yeah people are totally willing to live with it as long as you know what you're getting into with a Samsung phone fun fact this is also the year that Samsung unveiled the Galaxy home a small Weber grill shaped speaker designed to be an AI assistant in your house with Bixby it's been about 2,000 days since that announcement no word on it since then I don't think it's officially been cancelled maybe they just want us to forget about that one so then Samsung graduates to the Galaxy S10 this I think could be argued also maybe as Peak Samsung since they've now basically just gone full screen to the point where reviews are complaining about the last few millimeters of forehead and Chin like you see how the chin is just a tiny bit bigger but yeah up at the top we've gone right up to the earpiece and the selfie camera is now a cutout in the top right hand corner giving birth to a whole new genre of meme wallpapers screen to body ratio is approaching 9 0% now and we're basically just looking at Samsung's best-in-class 1440p AMOLED and not much else and now these phones have gotten irreversibly big S10 has a 6.1in display and the S10 plus would be 6.4 borderline tablet sized 10 years removed from the original but truly entering us into the Modern Age this is the first Samsung phone with more than one camera on the back and in Samsung fashion they just jump straight to three obviously so there's a primary camera a 2X telephoto camera and a0 5x Ultra wide phones would never look the same after this point every phone up until now so far has had just that tiny little camera bump just a single little circle or oval on the back but as soon as you open this box you're never going back cameras are now a feature on the back of a phone and you'll also notice there is no fingerprint reader on the back of this phone because this is also the first one that they tried that ultra Sonic fingerprint reader underneath the display glass and it's they pretty much nailed it right from the get-go I remember testing it and seeing if it will work underwater and if it was scratched at all it was fine it haven't really improved in much since these days so it seems like they nailed it they still use it but the thing that maybe brought this phone the most into the age of modern smartphones might just be the price so Samsung's been throwing a ton of stuff at the wall for years and now they've just built out this whole lineup but S10 starts at $900 when it comes out and then they have the S10 Plus which starts at a th000 they also had an S10 5G which was an even bigger even more expensive version of the phone with a bigger battery to support you know 5G radios because 5G is sort of burgeoning at this time expensive phones I think that actually is why one of my favorite new releases around this time was this little new thing they made called the s10e and this thing you know it's not quite a mini but this is where Samsung made a couple little corner cutting decisions to separate the true Flagship from something a little more budget friend so for $750 it has a slightly smaller and slower charging battery and a power button fingerprint reader instead of the ultrasonic unders screen one but honestly probably a better deal than the flagships that it was up against so now on to the next one Galaxy s20 and no we didn't skip any phones here basically 2020 is the year Samsung decided that they were going to sync up the year of the calendar with the year of the phone so we have s20 in 2020 I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact that the number was always slightly behind the FL Flagship iPhone but now this galaxy s20 looks blank boring soulless what happened like this feels like this is a complete blank phone like if you put the S10 next to the s20 and then not to jump too far forward but the S21 it looks like they took a year off with the s20 like this might be the most generic phone of all time now to be fair there are other phones that have looked like this and again this is Samsung's flagship for years and we know they're going to start to play it safe but in hindsight this one is pretty dull it also happens to be the first ever Galaxy S since the very beginning to move the volume rocker to the right side that's a choice it also is the first one to not say the model number on the back at all with the text it's just blank and it's also the first Galaxy S to follow in the footsteps of the iPhone after making fun of them and removing the headphone jack also a choice now I do love that this was officially the first Galaxy S Flagship with 120 Herz display and they actually moved the smaller hole punch camera to the top middle and was the first to be able to record 8K video so it's still gaining capabilities it's not like the ball didn't move forward at all with this phone but probably the more interesting Dynamic is what was happening at the very top of the lineup see this is the first year of the Ultra phone so s20 still a regularized phone th000 phone but they also decided to make a gigantic phone with the most possible numbers and the highest 10 possible specs and make it an Ultra and this was kind of fighting at the top of the lineup with the Galaxy Note because up until this point you know they tried a whole bunch of stuff and they ended up having this particularly successful high-end phone with a stylus in it that was if you wanted even more than the S could offer you could go buy a Galaxy Note so this phone in this year kind of just like its design just kind of got forgotten until later in the year when they dropped The Fan Edition the Fe of the exact same phone cut a couple things things down 1080p removed like one or two features 700 bucks and this phone was a great deal this one my phone of the year but also fun not so fun fact uh this galaxy s20 has also started swelling like the battery has started to bulge to the point where it's pushing the back of the phone off of the chassis through the glue so I'll just say I've had a lot of smartphones come through the studio we review a lot of phones obviously and we've had basically a large sample size of smartphones in long-term storage and the only brand that's had more than one smartphone whose battery swells up like a balloon to the point where we have to get rid of it is Samsung but then the year was 2021 and Samsung drops Galaxy S21 definitely bringing us up to the current design language that is so recognizable as a Samsung phone so this triple camera is now on the corner of the back it's unmistakable now in fact this might be their best one with the metal piece melting over the sides and specifically this purple and gold color way I think it's kind of iconic this is also the beginning of the base models being extremely boring I'm calling it now like the the the action's way higher and lower in the lineup like the note fighting the ultra for Supremacy that's crazy also The Fan Edition and the a series kind of fighting each other to be the best overall value but sitting in the middle kind of in no man's land that just can't mess anything up and has to play it safe well that's exactly what the S21 did they actually bumped down to a 1080p display they are back to Flat displays now no more expandable storage in this model no more charger in the Box for this model whatever the industry is doing that's what they're doing like there's no leadership here there's just just enough brand cache that like if they make a Samsung version of the phone that everyone's buying in stores and put it next to that in the store people will just buy the Samsung one so Galaxy s22 is more along the same track slightly more boring colors slightly flatter edges all the way around but on the upside this thing also does basically have perfectly thin bezels all the way around at this point so I think the screen to body ratio now is well into the '90s and frankly I don't even care what the number is anymore I just feel like there's so little bezel to hold with my fingers that anything less wouldn't really make any sense so the bezel is effectively gone at this point it makes perfect sense to go back to the perfectly flat displays because Samsung has now realized and everyone else has realized that those curved displays they're kind of cool and they looked cool in the past but they were kind of a crutch to make the phone appear to have a larger screen to body ratio than it actually did but now that we have the tech to go right up to the edges and the corners you don't have to curve the display anymore it just looks sick and is flatter and is more durable so actually maybe the most notable change on the outside here is these phones are now slightly smaller than the previous year so it went from 6.2 and 6.7 in to 6.1 and 6.6 in for s22 and s22 plus and there is no doubt in my mind that that is specifically to give more room and a bigger Gap to the Ultra phone at the top of the lineup the ultra has been doing battle with the note it's winning it stole the Spen from it and so with these boring default base phones for 750 bucks flat totally fine just just look up there though there's some more expensive phones you can spend more money so the Galaxy s23 was interesting for one reason and one reason only no more exos version so every single Galaxy s23 and Galaxy s23 plus and s23 Ultra ships with the same slightly customized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy and yeah performance is great you know for all the years that they've been trying to catch up the exos chip to the Snapdragon chip they finally gave up on it which you could argue is good news because everyone now gets the good Snapdragon performance and efficiency now but it's also kind of bad news because there's less competition there's that much less incentive for Qualcomm to do anything particularly great here the whole goal for exos chips was supposed to be better customization and integration and while we got rid of that they can still claim with s23 to have done at least some customization because they've like I said they've made it a 4 Galaxy chip so it's not quite the off-the-shelf one every else gets what's different slightly higher clock speeds slightly more powerful cuz they've got better Cooling in these phones so mission accomplished aside from that they've removed even more character by getting rid of the signature camera bump and making an even more generic and Universal appeal phone than ever before just same set of cameras same aspect ratio same features just slightly more battery in both versions nobody's saying these phones are bad they're just not not making exciting strides the way they used to back in the day which brings us to this year's Samsung Galaxy s24 even more boring colors and even more generic design and even more playing it safe than ever before this year it's the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and this chip enables some pretty substantial AI features which they lean into it makes the phones really good stuff like live translation and generative photo editing call screening and my personal favorite Circle to search is awesome but a lot of the AI features are now making their way to some other phones and circle to search isn't an exclusive the pixel has that too and frankly aside from just getting flatter edges and slightly bigger batteries they share a lot of parts with the previous year's phones like the cameras uh the screen resolutions they bumped up a little bit but functionally the same screen to body ratios the same maybe the buttons are clicker maybe that's enough these phones are all grown up now so now we've seen the glow up the the different eras the plastic to the glass the iconic to the static but my favorite way to visualize all these different types of improvements is the graphs so welcome to my favorite section the graph section now before we jump fully in a quick word from our Channel sponsor dbrand fun fact they've been supporting these devices since the Galaxy S4 that is a long time now they're also supporting all the way up to Galaxy s24 and I think this year with these phones a lot of us were expecting to get ch2 support to get kind of like that ring of Mag safe style magnets but for whatever reason the Stars didn't align so this phone doesn't have that but with dbrands cases for the s24 series they all come with magnets built in so that means basically any ch2 or mag safe accessories will work on the s24 so they essentially give you that easy alignment on any wireless charger pretty sick uh you can check it out at the link below in the description so let's take a look at how far these phones have come these are really interesting and there's a couple of them I think Samsung is the first one one that has notable ups and downs in their progress graphs which is really interesting it kind of feels like they're going backwards but there's reasons behind all of it also this could be a way crazier graph because they obviously split out and Fork into a bunch of different models The Edge models the plus models the ultra models the active models but I'm just sticking with just the base models just for pure Simplicity of visuals so first up screen sizes so these are the screen sizes of the base Sam Galaxy S over every single year starting at the original 4in Samsung Galaxy S then really quickly jumping up into the fives and then kind of slowing down and settling in right around 6 in you can actually see a slight dip where the S10 was 6.1 in then it was 6.2 again then back to 6.1 to make room for the ultra then back up to 6.2 again feels like now there's a sort of a dedicated gigantic phone so this rate of growth has pretty much evened out so the huge phone is the ultra which is 6.8 in which is crazy but here's a fun fact based on this chart maybe it's not a fact but you can make an argument that the Galaxy s20 was kind of peak Samsung cuz that is the same screen size as today's Base phone but hold that thought let's look now at battery sizes so you know battery life hasn't really improved dramatically we're still at a day for a good phone but the physical capacity of these batteries able to fit in these phones has improved significantly as well so you can see it starts at500 milliamp hours removable of course and nearly doubles by the Galaxy S5 but then it dips right when they introduce the edge phones then they shoot back up again but again kind of flatlines in line with a certain memorable battery related event but then they eventually got the courage to walk back up the base phone all the way to 4,000 milliamp and what do you know again you can argue Galaxy s20 is Peak Samsung that's the first year of the 4,000 mAh battery and that is still the battery size again now the primary camera megapixel count this one's a little more interesting maybe a little more classic improvement over time of course megapixels don't mean everything but it's fun to see the priorities increase over time at the beginning there was a lot of incentive to just level up from 720p to 1080p video and then to 4K video but once we hit 8K you know there's not any reason to go too crazy with megapixels beyond that of course the highest end Ultra phones quickly blasted the ceiling way up all the way to 100 megapixels and then 200 this year which is nuts but for the Baseline phone you know most people's screens aren't 50 megapixels so I think this is a very appropriate Plateau but then last but not least starting price we all know what happened with smartphones over the years and here you can see it visualized the steep climb through 400 500 600 bucks right up to the $900 ceiling for the Bas Galaxy S this is the base phone now the most expensive phone has of course gotten dramatically more expensive too so again that ceiling lifting with the ultra has allowed Samsung to go way up to $1,300 starting and today you can pay 1660 for the 1 TB Galaxy s24 Ultra but that has at least helped bump the base price back down a little bit to the $799 of today so that's how we got from here to here from Galaxy S1 to s24 these videos are super fun to sort of look back and actually visualize that progress over time I also feel like I already know which one we want to do next get subscribed make sure you see that coming up either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace from two gigs all I deserve that\", metadata={'source': 'eKVTFXQPAhs', 'title': 'Reviewing EVERY Samsung Galaxy S Ever!',

      "[Document(page_content=\"(upbeat music) - So this smartwatch has one really interesting\\ntrick up its sleeve that I haven't seen in any\\nother, and that, honestly, I don't think we're ever gonna see again. So at this point we know what a smartwatch is already, right? This is a stable, mature category. They deliver mostly across the board on all the same functions. And aside from the one crazy trick, this one is no exception. This is the OnePlus Watch 2, three years after the\\noriginal OnePlus Watch and it costs 300 bucks. So for the $300 you're spending, you're getting a pretty\\nnice circular watch design. It comes in this black or\\nsilver stainless steel body and a sapphire cover glass over a 1.4 inch, 60 hertz AMOLED display. Design-wise, you could argue it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11 or the OnePlus 12 with\\nthe way the camera bump is melted into the side rail of the phone. They've done a similar thing here with the buttons on the side of the watch. So there's a circular button at the top and this rectangular button at the bottom. And I kind of like it. It's a nice shape. It's got this little\\nsubtle, classy variation of just the pure circle. And then the back looks\\npretty standard too. You got the four pins at the\\ntop, those are for charging. And it has all the sensors you'd expect for a smartwatch in the middle, optical heart rate sensor, pulse oximeter for blood oxygen, and of course, it still has\\nthe interchangeable bands, same as gen one. And the whole thing is actually both IP 68 dust and water resistant and reaches a US military\\nstandard for durability. Basically means it can also\\nwithstand extreme temperature and moisture and shock among other things.\\n(watch taps) It's not too heavy,\\nit's built pretty well. This display goes up to a\\nthousand nits peak brightness. So it looks good. It's\\nbuilt well across the board. Nice. So what's the catch? What's the weird twist? Well at the beginning I\\nmentioned like we already kind of know what a smartwatch is, which is a tiny computer on\\nyour wrist with a tiny screen and a tiny battery. And that's fine. Like they all tend to have\\npretty short battery lives just because they're so small, and so you kind of just\\ncharge 'em every day. And that's the way it is. Like the main competitors\\nhere are the Apple Watch, which is 18 hours, although that's not the\\nmost direct competitor 'cause that's the iPhone. But the Galaxy Watch, one of the best, 40 hours of battery, and the Pixel Watch, the newest one, 24 hours of battery life. But this one, OnePlus\\nis claiming 100 hours. 100 hour battery life in Smart Mode, which is not the battery saving mode, it's actually the\\ndefault mode out the box. 100 hours. So 96 hours is four days. I feel like, you know, 100 sounds cooler so they just went with 100. But four days of battery\\nsounds a lot less inconvenient. So, you know, I had to\\nput that to the test. So for the past four straight days I've been that guy walking around with both an Apple Watch Ultra, which claims 36 hours of normal use and this thing. Doing all the same stuff\\nwith both watches on, getting notifications, doing workouts, just poking around the UI. And by the end, I was actually\\nvery impressed with both. So the $800 Apple Watch Ultra actually over performed the\\n36 claimed hours for me. By hour 56 it was about ready to die. Now meanwhile, the OnePlus\\nWatch had about 15% left. Now you're probably thinking, wait, that's not even close to\\n100, it's like 50 something. But OnePlus told me that if you turn the always on display off, that's good for two more\\ndays of battery life, it's actually off by default. I turned it on for this test, but that would get you well\\nover the 100 hour mark. To be fair, that's also probably true about the Apple Watch Ultra. Now one detail to consider\\nthat I think actually mattered for this particular test. I've been wearing hoodies a lot 'cause it's that type of weather. And so even with the sleeves\\non this Chevron Hoodie, which I'll link it below 'cause you probably wanna check it out. It covers the watch. And so when you cover the\\nwatch with your sleeve, it thinks it's in the dark 'cause the light sensors are covered so it turns the brightness\\nway down on the watch. And so I think that's why it outperformed the battery numbers that it's claiming is 'cause I had a sleeve\\nover it a lot of the times and the brightness was low. But even still, this $300 watch outperformed this $800 smartwatch\\njust in terms of battery. Now here's the thing. The way that they're\\nachieving this battery life is, I think, more interesting\\nthan the battery life itself. This is the twist. See, most smart watches\\nhave a chip inside, computing everything, with some high powered cores\\nand some high efficiency cores to balance out power and battery life. This watch has two entirely\\nseparate processors and two different operating systems running for each of them. So there's a high powered\\nSnapdragon W5 inside, that's powering Wear OS 4 and that only lights up for\\nthings connected to that. Then there's also a BES 2,700 chip that is always on and runs RTOS. And they both share the\\nsame 32 gigs of base storage and two gigs of RAM. So Wear OS kicks on for\\nthe more intensive tasks like maps or music playback. But the RTOS that's always on is for those basic, low power tasks: heart rate monitoring, phone calls, notifications, background stuff. It's like a hybrid car. It's really interesting. And a fully electric car,\\nyou guys already know has all the benefits of\\nbeing really responsive but not the best range. But a gas car has a ton of range, just not as responsive as fully electric. So if you get a hybrid,\\nbest of the both worlds, responsive and range. And this watch, it's a hybrid\\nwith the best of both worlds, responsiveness and range. So I've been pretty impressed. You know, using this\\nthing, it's responsive. It has a ton of watch faces. There's a lot of custom workouts which look very familiar with tracking and everything that\\nstill sends all the data to the OHealth app in\\nplenty of detail for me. I do still wish now, shoveling\\nsnow was a workout type, but that's another story. But you know, these here are\\nregular weightlifting workouts. And also, can I say I\\nreally like that it is hold to end the workout, not tap to end. So it's way harder to\\naccidentally stop a workout. Great idea. Also another weird quirk, this button here has a crown that rotates. But that rotation doesn't\\nactually do anything. It doesn't change the volume, it doesn't scroll up or down in anything. It does nothing. It's not\\nconnected to anything. It just freely spins. apparently, that's\\nliterally just to make it more durable upon impact. Doesn't serve any function. Also, it does have this weird hitch, that it hasn't really\\ngotten any less annoying, which is if I get a notification, I feel the buzz on my wrist, then I lift up my wrist and it takes like a full two seconds to show me the notification I just got. Not that two seconds is a\\ndisaster, it's not a ton of time, but it's longer than you expect, and it kind of annoys me to have to wait in comparison to other watches, which will just show me the\\nnotification right away. And I feel like you can\\nactually see the moment that it fires up the Snapdragon W5 and Wear OS kind of snaps\\non right in front of you before it shows you that notification. It's very odd. But here's the other twist on top of everything we've already talked about. I don't think this dual chip system is all of the magic creating\\nthis great battery life, because this watch also has\\na 500 MilliAmp hour battery. Now 500 MilliAmp hours\\ndoesn't sound like a lot, but here's the sizes\\nof other smart watches in competition with this\\nand their battery sizes and how long they last. And it's a little bigger\\nthan you'd expect. Now if I gave the Pixel Watch 2, which also has a\\nSnapdragon W5, by the way. If I gave the Pixel Watch 2\\na 500 MilliAmp hour battery, do we think it would last 50 hours? I don't know, but there you go. Honestly, at the end of the day I just came away from\\nthis mostly just impressed that they actually kept the\\nprice of this watch so low. Because two chips and two OSs and the work that goes into that, I dunno, to me that just sounds expensive and it's really not missing\\nanything else too drastic. I think it's competitive in a\\nlot of good ways at 300 bucks. So I think the clear positives would be: a nice design, really classy\\nlooking design, nice display, dual frequency GPS, so\\nthat's for better accuracy, and then of course\\nreally good battery life. The four days we talked about is awesome, but if you put on power saver mode, it's up to 12 days of battery life. Now this is gonna disable a\\nlot of the Wear OS things, so it's just basic stuff,\\nexercises, heart rate monitoring, but you could get it to really\\nlast a week if you wanted to. But then the weaknesses are definitely the delay in\\nchecking your notifications. The haptics also aren't that nice, and there's no iPhone compatibility, but you already knew that. But I would also say the\\ncharger is not that cool. Honestly, it's kind of clunky. I mean it works perfectly\\nfine, don't get me wrong, but it's just like a big plastic block with pins and magnets in it. But it'll get you a full\\nday's charge in 10 minutes and a full charge in an hour. So that's acceptable. But for 300 bucks, I'd say\\nOnePlus has redeemed itself from its previous\\nefforts in smart watches. It's pretty good. Like in a world of smartwatch gimmicks, there's the one with earbuds inside, there's the one for fitness, there's the one for the iPhone. Maybe this is the one\\nwith the hybrid system and pretty good battery life. (upbeat music)\\nMaybe that's enough for you. Let me know in the comments below. Either way, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you the next one. Peace.

      "[Document(page_content=\"that's all right so this is simultaneously really impressive and really frightening at the same time and it's hitting me in ways that I didn't really expect so do you remember Will Smith eating spaghetti do you remember when this was what AI generated videos look like remember when we said okay this AI stuff is cool and all but clearly there's a long way to go before there's any need for concern well welcome to the Future people because this is also an AI generated video and so is this completely synthesized out of thin air by computers this one too this is not real absolutely ridiculous how far we've come in literally one year this does feel like another chat GPT Dolly moment for AI and maybe I'm overreacting because okay I'm a video creator so an AI that's actually doing my job maybe that feels a little more threatening so I'm particularly impressed by it but also so this this stuff is really good so today Sam Altman and open AI announced a new model called sora and it can generate full up to one minute video clips from just text input so the same way dolly was able to understand our text input and turn it into a photo realistic or stylized image or whatever you want same thing with Sora but now since it's videos it also needs to understand how all these things like refle and textures and materials and physics all interact with each other over time to make a reasonable looking video and of course right away there's a bunch of examples on their website that are crazy now before I show you these I just need you to keep this in mind you're about to watch a bunch of AI generated videos and you know that you're about to watch a bunch of AI generated content so your brain you're already looking for this stuff and it's not perfect you will find imperfections but not everybody who sees AI gener ated content on the internet knows to be looking for that so also keep that in mind this is also the worst that this technology is going to be from here on now so okay here's one of the videos there's no audio to any of these clips but the prompt for this one is a stylish woman walks down a Tokyo Street filled with warm glowing neon and animated City signage she wears a black leather jacket a long red dress and black boots this video is already m ahead of where we were it has accurate lighting it has materials it has skin tones movements even has Reflections all over the place now of course if you look at it for more than about 10 seconds very closely there are lots of giveaways like this dude in the background kind of looks like he's gliding in a weird way the frame rates and the Reflections in the water are for some reason lower than the rest of the video the camera movement overall is just a bit inconsistent and it just I don't know it just kind of feels a little bit off but then again this this is where we were one year ago so just keep that in the back of your head for all this okay how about this one this is another one which has a long prompt about a camera following behind a white vintage SUV with a black roof rack as it speeds up a steep dirt road this is also again really good this kind of looks a little more video gamey because of how Rock Solid the Drone footage is but clearly very usable here's another one a litter of golden retriever puppies playing in the snow their heads pop in and out of the snow covered in it it's so good it feels like the physics of the fur and the ears and everything with the snow flying around in slow motion is incredible I've looked through all of the sample videos on open ai's website and clearly these are the handpicked best ones that they chose to share where they just put in some text and then get a video and don't modify it but there's really impressive stuff in there some of it has humans some of it doesn't some of it is more realistic feeling like the truck driving one but some some of them are more video gamey or more stylized a lot of it is slow motion I just have to say how insanely fast these models are improving is genuinely like that's the shocking part like I remember not even that many months ago Dolly 3 really really high end and you could always still find something off about it like especially if you ask it for something like a photorealistic image of a human something about like the hands or the ears would always just be a little bit off never mind the physics but even this video here is crazy at first glance The Prompt for this AI generated video is a young man in his 20s is sitting on a piece of a cloud in the sky reading a book this one feels like 90% of the way there for me like it's beyond the uncanny valley of like apples personas which are actually based on humans this is a madeup person I mean his eyes are kind of weird and the motion of the pages in the book are kind of odd and yeah obviously he's in a cloud and that's a giveaway but like the lighting and the shadows and the skin tones and then all the realism of the textures on the shirt and the way the the shirt and the pants move and the hair they're all really impressive and then for this one they typed in a movie trailer featuring the adventurers of the 30-year-old Spaceman wearing a red wool knitted motorcycle helmet Blue Sky salt desert cinematic style shot on 35mm film and the close-up of his face the Fabrics on the helmet the film grain through every shot and the Cinematic style this is one of the most convincing AI generated videos I've ever seen minus maybe the weird physics of that dude walking kind of in fast motion so Sam Alman if you follow him on Twitter he's going through a whole bunch more of like people's requests and posting a bunch more generated videos and so if you want to check out his profile you can see those but here's the thing about these AI generated videos now as good as they've gotten to this point they can and will pass as real videos to people who are not looking for AI generated videos now that is obviously insanely sketchy during an election year in the US and also terrifying for a bunch of other internet related reasons but it's also perfect for stock footage like there are already all kinds of presentations and advertisements and then PowerPoints that are in need of oddly specific stock videos and these AI generated videos are already good enough to 100% pass for that purpose like look at this one this one with the waves at Big Sir this drone shot honestly if I saw this on Twitter I wouldn't even think twice I'd be like oh nice drone shot dude wouldn't even think about AI if I wasn't pixel peeping at like the way the water was moving like this this is a totally usable video in an ad for some California based product and that has all sorts of implications for the Drone pilot that no longer needs to be hired for all the photographers and videographers whose footage no longer needs to be licensed to show up in that ad that's being made it's already that good there's other stuff like this wall of TVs which would be a totally expensive and difficult thing to shoot with a camera and all these old expensive props but if you can just generate it this well with reflections and the environment and everything else around it I mean why do it any other way it's also very capable of historical themed footage so this is supposed to be California during the Gold Rush it's AI generated but it could totally pass for the opening scene in an old western with the right music over it how long until an entire ad every single shot is completely generated with AI or what about an entire YouTube video or an entire movie I'm tempted to say like we're a long way away from that because you know this still has flaws clearly and there's no sound and there's a long way to go with the prompt engineering to iron these things out but then again the the spaghetti was like a year ago now actually like that open AI on their website they show some of the downfalls too of this particular model and because Who would know better than the people who have been using it this is a a very private tool by the way right now it's in super limited access so it's in the hands of red teamers which basically means people testing it pushing the limits trying to break it and a few Trust creators but they have found uh plenty of weird Edge stuff like this clip here of a bunch of gray wolf pups looks normal at first but then it's pretty clear that something's kind of off with the way they're just kind of appearing out of nowhere and walking through each other that's kind of weird or this clip of a guy running on a treadmill which I mean I don't really have to say much more about why this one's weird but this is my favorite one again so again just try to try to put yourself in the mind of someone who's not expecting AI you're just scrolling through Facebook or Twitter or something right so you just see this video so first I just want you to watch this clip as if it's just a stock video you found of a grandma celebrating her birthday and just try to try to think like what I wonder what birthday she's celebrating right I don't know how old do you think she is 60 65 maybe it's the big 70 she seems to really like that cake and did you did you see it did you catch that I'm going to I'm going to play it again but this time watch the video knowing that AI generated photos and videos have trouble accurately doing hands I'll play it again and now it feels super obvious like every time you watch it watch a different set of hands it gets weirder and weirder you can watch it like five times and there's dead giveaway after dead giveaway not even mentioning the weird inconsistencies with the direction of the wind on the candles but even as I'm saying all that even as it's coming out of my mouth I can't help but remember that 12 months ago we were critiquing this so what is this all mean well I mean there's what it means now and there's what it means for the future now Sora this thing that they've made is clearly a really impressive video generation AI tool that is both going to fool people and also be very useful there's there's also a a watermark in the bottom corner of every video generated by it so if you see one of those videos and ideally it hasn't been cropped out then that's at least a pretty clear indicator that it's a generated it's sore video but also I I do think they're going to have to be very careful with this they're they're going to have a whole bunch of safety stuff to keep in mind I think they'll probably have to be even more safe than Dolly like you shouldn't be able to generate people's likenesses like you shouldn't be able to make a politician look like they're doing something on video especially this year you probably won't be able to make Will Smith eating spaghetti but it also definitely means stock video generation is absolutely going to take a dent out of video licensing like I can basically guarantee that like logistically why would anyone making something pay for footage of a house in the cliffs when they can generate one for free or for a small subscription price like that is the real scary part of what this tool implies but in the future gets it gets pretty existential man I mean okay if this is trained on all videos that have ever been made by humans then surely it can't be Innovative or creative in ways that humans haven't already been right I don't know either way I'll have all the links below for all the Sora stuff for open AI stuff and I guess I'll talk to you next year when we look back and go remember that first version of Sora and how bad those wolf pups looked when they spawned out of nowhere just remember this is the worst that this technology is going to be from here on out that's hot thanks for watching that's hot catch you in the next one peace [Music]\", metadata={'source': 'NXpdyAWLDas', 'title': 'AI Generated Videos Just Changed Forever',

      "[Document(page_content=\"this course will prepare you for elite code style coding challenges you'll learn 10 important JavaScript algorithms interview questions to help you Ace your coding interviews mkar from coding monkey created this course he'll help you build a strong foundation in JavaScript algorithms and Tackle leak code problems with confidence hi welcome back to coding money in about 2 hours we'll work on top 10 JavaScript algorithms for beginners that will help you prepare for lead code problems these coding problems are for absolute beginners and these are meant to help you get better at coding and at the same time uh prepare you for your coding interview at Big tech companies like Google where the starting salary is $191,000 I have a bonus for you at the end of the video make sure you don't miss that so let's get started [Music] we'll be reversing a string and also an integer this is a very common coding interview question one way or the other you'll be required to reverse a string or integer as part of your coding interview challenge so let's get started all right so we got two coding challenges in this video we need to reverse a string and then later we'll reverse an integer we'll do the uh string first because once you know how to reverse the string you can easily reverse an integer all you would have to do is convert the uh integer into the string do the reversal and then convert back to the integer you'll have uh the solution uh so we are given a string we need to return a new string with the reverse order of the characters here are some of the examples uh pause the video right here and give it a try all right thank you for trying to solve this problem if you are not able to come up with a solution uh no worries at all I'll give you one possible solution to this problem I'll start off by creating a variable called reversed I'll set it to empty strings I'll do something with this uh variable and then uh return it at the end so what do you think I should be doing to this variable in order to uh reverse a string like coding money um so obviously uh you would have to Loop through each character of the string one by one and add each character to this reversed um variable but the next characters that you would insert you would insert before that so we will be doing something like this one by one to each character as you can see we'll have something like this at the end so to do that we need a loop and I'm sure you're all familiar with the for Loop so we'll do let I equals to zero I less than Str str. length I ++ and all we have to do is set reversed equal to St Str DOI the current character plus add to the previous ones reversed reversed and at the end we're just going to re uh return the reverse let me run the code to see if it works so here I'm going to call the function coding money as you can see it is revers vers the string for us so this is a solution but as you can see for this uh traditional for Loop there are many moving pieces like you need to set a variable here you know you need to check for the condition and you need to set the incrementer here so there's uh there are many areas that things can go wrong so my suggestion would be to use the uh newer um JavaScript syntax you can do the same thing as let car of Str Str and all you have to do replace this with the car and if I save it and I try to run this again you see it does the same thing but this is much cleaner there's even an easier way uh to solve this problem the reason I gave you this solution uh because sometimes the interviewer might uh prevent you from using that built-in function people who have used JavaScript for some time they already know that there's a built-in reverse function why not use that sometimes the interviewer might not allow you to use that so I give you this solution in case that happens to you so let me copy this solution uh let me copy the whole function and save it here for your future reference uh by the way I've created a GitHub repository where I'll be posting a lot more coding um challenges um I'll post the link in the description so be sure to check that out and follow it because I'll be posting lead code problems and a lot of other coding interview challenges uh let me show you the mdn documentation for the build Buon reverse method as you can see uh this method is uh used on arrays we can only use this on arrays um however we are working with strings now so we need to find a way to convert the string into an array uh to do the reversal and then convert back the array into a string so let's do that okay let's create a variable called um uh Str to array so the way we convert a string to an array is by using uh method called split uh so if we don't pass anything it's going to uh split each character in the string into uh an element in an array so once uh we have that we can just call the reverse method on Str Str St R2 array we can call the reverse function this will reverse uh the array but we need uh to return uh a string so for that case Str str2 array we need to join it how do we join it the same way that we use the split we just join back the elements in the array into a string so if I wrun run this as you can see we'll get the same output we can even minimize uh this syntax this code we can write all of this in one line uh because of something called chaining in JavaScript so we can change chain the whole thing in one line so how can we do that so let me remove all of it and return so so I'll get the input string I'll call split onto it to convert it into an array then I can call reverse and then I can join it back and this is the reverse string and if I save it run it we get the same output so with this new knowledge that you have of a string reversal you can easily reverse integers uh so this should be very easy I highly recommend you pause the video right here and give it a try thank you for trying to solve this problem I hope you were able to find a solution I'm sure uh if you did try this uh problem you came across the edge case where you have a negative number as the input and you would have to return an negative reversed uh number so we're going to take care of that now there are many ways to solving this problem I'm going to give you one possible solution so I'm going to create a variable called reversed so um you already know how to convert a string uh so we need to convert the integer into a string and to do that we can use in. to string method and then pretty much do the same thing we did for the string split it into uh an array uh now run the reverse on the array why we're uh converting it into array because the reverse method only works on the arrays and then we will join it back join if I return this and I let me run this function um 15 as you can see we're reversing it and we returning a string this is not an integer we need to return an integer and also we need to uh for example if I run it with 15 uh you will see that the sign will come after the number uh this is not correct so we need to uh first of all convert at the string into an integer and the way we're going to do that is by using pars int okay and and then we need to multiply this with uh a a positive one if uh if it is uh a positive number and if it is a negative number we need to convert this into for example a -1 so uh we already have a function for that it's matt. sign and we need to provide the input string n so whatever the sign for this uh input is we're going to use that over here uh so I'm going to pass the input string over here and now if I run the code you should get uh the correct uh negative uh integer in the Reversed order we're given a string we need to return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not P what is a palindrome palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed for example kayak if you reverse this word you'll get the same word so uh we need to return true in that case similarly Madam if you reverse it you'll get the same thing however for coding money if you reverse it you'll get something like this and this is not equal to this therefore we need to return false so we already know how to reverse a string um if you do not know how to do that you can watch the last video I uh would like you uh to solve this problem pause the video right here and then come back uh we will work on one possible solution all right I hope you were able to find the solution for this problem if if you didn't uh don't worry we'll uh work on it right now uh so first of all we need to uh find the reverse of the given uh input string so uh we'll create a variable called reversed and we'll reverse the uh input string Str Str um um we'll call the split function on it why because we we need to convert it into an array why because we uh need uh to run reverse function on it and this uh function only works on the arrays and once it's reversed we can join it uh like that uh turn it back into a string so now we have under reversed um of the input string and we need to check for it now so if the input string is equal to reversed then we need to return uh true um otherwise if it fails then we need to return false at the end let's run this function to check uh run the function to see if it works so I'm going to say pend Drome uh I run it with kayak first uh let me save it and then I'll run yeah so uh it's working fine I'm getting the desired result which is true let me try with uh coding money we should get false in this case as you can see uh this is working fine and it's a very easy um problem um and the videos that the future videos will build upon the knowledge from the previous videos so expect that the next videos to get U more difficult so we can um we can write all of this in one line line we can do the comparison right here we can get rid of this and do the comparison right here like this and this will still work let me run it see it's working fine uh I'm I'm going to give you an assignment homework uh you can come up with a solution um there's another technique called the two- pointers technique if you want to learn about that do some research uh find out what it does and try to solve this problem with the two-pointer technique or there's another uh JavaScript built-in method called every you can use that to solve this uh so when you do it just paste your result in the comment section and you'll get a thumbs up from me today we're going to work on a very common uh coding interview question uh given a string return the character that is most commonly used in the string uh example uh if you're given a a string like a b c c c d then we will return the character C because C is the most commonly used character in this string and as you can see in this uh second example you see one is repeated the most and this string therefore will return the character one uh not the number one so um once you um learn how to solve this problem using the technique that I'm going to give you in this video you'll be able to solve variety of other common string questions uh for example what is the most common characters in a string does a string a have the same characters as string B anagram questions does the given string have any repeated characters in it these are some examples of the uh problems that you would be able to solve uh by using the method that I'm going to teach you in this video but first I would like you to give this problem a try I'll be right here pause the video all right welcome back I hope you were able to find a solution um if not uh doesn't matter we'll work on it right now um just by looking at this problem um we uh know that we need some kind of a data structure to keep uh the count of uh each character in a given string so we would need a character map let me give you an example something like this A1 um B one and see not sure how many like about seven and D1 just um something like this we need something uh like this okay so to come up um with something like this we already have a data structure in JavaScript called um you know object JavaScript objects are like this um we can also use another data structure called Maps which is um something new um but um we'll use an object um in this um case so um but how to uh do this how how can we uh of course we would have to Loop over through each character like one by one in a given string and try to count it and then store the values in this object okay so let's get started uh of course we would need an object so we will create an object called character map car map and we'll set it to an empty object okay and now we need to Loop over the string we we need to Loop over uh each uh character in a string and um and add the value to the character map um so to Loop over a string or an array we use we can use the same syntax um for for uh let car of s Str uh Str Str is the input so we need to see uh we need to see if there's already a value in the character map if there is then we need to increment the value if for example if there's no entry for a we need to create an a new entry for a and set it to equal one I mean the first time we set the value we will set it to one and then um uh if we come across the same character we need to increment the value so to do that we we'll check the character map for that value if there's the if we have the character uh in the character map then we will we'll increment it by one if you don't have it then we'll we'll set the value as one okay like for example how how would this uh how this Loop would work um it's very easy so we're going to Loop over each string and so so for example when we are at a we'll see that if there is uh a in the character map no there is not so we'll set a equal to one all right then it goes to B uh do we have B in the character map no we don't have it so we'll set b equal to one so the else part will run um so when it comes to C do we have C in the character map no so we'll set it to one and then again it will come to C do we have C in the character map yes we we have so increment by one so it will become two and it will again come to C C do we have C yes we have so we will increment by one so it will be three it will keep on doing this and un unless until we have the character map with uh um with the count of each character in in our input string so we will have that right just um to be sure let me return it uh to say that our character map is working so let me save this um let me run this okay we need to call the function so let me call this one I need to save it and run it as you can see we have created uh our character map with the count of each character um in the input string so we have something like this as I was showing you in the example before now this this is object right we need to Loop through uh the object uh to find um which one uh is uh the most commonly used uh character in the string so I'll I'll show you two ways of uh looping the objects one way is uh old uh way of uh looping through an object um and I'll give you a newer way of looping through object which is much easier um so let me uh first of all give you um uh the older syntax and the way that we Loop through the object is by converting it into an array and how we can convert an object into an array is by using something called object. entries and passing uh the object in our case it is character map so to Loop over then we we we have uh it will return an array with the keys and value just like in our character map these are the keys and these are the values that we created earlier so um we need to use a for Loop to Loop through this array now so for that we say for const uh destructure it so I'll destructure and get the key and value from this array so of object. entries like this and then yeah so this is how we're going to Loop to through uh you know an object by convert converting it into a c let me show you H how it looks like so let me uh uh let me console like this so we get we get key and value so let me save this and run it see so we get the the key and the value this is uh this is the output from this loop as you can see so we get the keys and values okay all right so now what do we need to do we need to find which one is the maximum like we need to find uh you know uh give an instruction to the computer to find uh C like the the we can see like we humans we can see that this one is the most commonly used character but we need to tell the computer to find this one so to do that we need to um check each one we need to check each one of these to see which one is the maximum and to keep account for that one we need to create another variable called Max and uh set it to zero and also to get the character uh the max character we we we'll need to create another um variable and set this to uh an empty string so now now we'll just uh check for a condition like we'll see we'll say if if value oops if value is greater than Max so we'll see like the first one if is this greater than Max which is zero yes then we'll set this Max to the value and um and Max jar to the key right so this will Loop uh loop through each one like this will uh first of all it goes takes a see is this greater than uh zero yes then it updates the value for Max and Max CH to a it comes to B is this greater than uh one because it's been changed to one yes it is no it is not then it skips that it comes to C it see it sees that whether the value which is um seven greater than one yes then set the value to seven Max to seven and uh set max Char to the key which is uh what C and return what we need to return the max score let me save this and run it all right so we are getting the correct output from uh our code this is a working code but now we're going to try to uh optimize it a bit and I'll show you I said I'll show you a newer way uh an easier way to Loop through the objects all right so we can use uh a similar syntax that we used to Loop through the string we can use this uh syntax to Loop through arrays as well uh so we can use something like this for the objects as well so how uh can we do that there just a small little change so we can say let let key of um car map as you can see this is exactly same syntax but we can't use uh let key of uh uh object which is a car map we cannot use that for the objects the change that we need to bring is we need to change off with n uh so this is a bit uh opposite of each other so when you want to Loop through the arrays and strings you will um write off um and O starts like object starts with o so that's not what you're going to use for uh objects you will use n uh for the objects so now um here uh to check the value we need to say jart map key okay for the value this is how we're going to write it and so for the key we just write key over here uh let me save the code run it again okay we are having a problem here uh as you can see uh it's case sensitive so we need to be careful with naming um with um our code so let's run it again see we're getting the same output but this one is much nicer cleaner code and um you know you need you just need to remember very few things to um you know be able to Loop through the objects uh however the earlier example had like you need to do remember object do entries and then you need to remember to pass the object into that um method so this one is much easier this this is my personal opinion also we can refactor this code to make it much uh smaller um so we can convert the same code in just one line of code so here we can say if character map okay and if there is a character map then we will add one to it or if it does not exist exist then we'll what we will do is we'll just uh uh you know use one so let's see okay let me save it and run the code as you can see this looks much uh uh you know cleaner and short as you can see we just convert the F uh you know statement into one line of code uh you can do this like even uh if it is too much to do like plus one you can do something like Plus+ character map or one so if you save it and you see our code is working fine let's run the other test [Music] case should get one yes it's working just fine we are given an array and a chunk size divide the array into many subarrays where each sub array is of length size for example if you're given an array with elements of 1 2 3 4 then we need to divide this array into chunks of length two for example the output should be an array containing sub arrays of length two here are some other test cases and examples for better understanding of this problem I would suggest you to pause the video here give this problem a try all right thank you for trying to solve this problem uh we're going to work on one possible way of solving this uh coding challenge um the first thing uh that I do when I get a coding problem is that uh I use the divide in conquer technique where I get the problem and divide it into smaller problems so the first problem that I'm uh looking at is to be able to figure out how to get the first two ele elements from this array how to get the chunk of an array right so let me run uh the function uh and run this first test case over here so what I would like to do is to get the first two elements from this array and the way that we can do that uh is by using a buil-in array function called slice let me open up the mdn documentation it says the slice method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from the start to the end end not included where start and end represent the index items in that array the original array is not modified so let's uh let's use this to get the first two elements so the way that we can do that is array do slice the arrays are um zero indexed which means the first element is zero then it is one 2 and three like this so to be able to get uh the first two we'll provide the first index which is zero and then um the second index is two so in this case we we have this two so this is great we can use the size here so uh let me return this and see what we get in the output yeah so we get the first two elements from the array so now we solved the small problem that will C and hand handy in solving the bigger problem right so now we know that we need to return an array right so we would uh need to create an empty um array here uh let let's call it result so and at the end we will return this result okay um we'll return this result but first we need to get the chunks from array and um push it in this array right so um so how we can do that we can do it like this result. push and we can put uh we can uh push uh this uh chunk inside of this array the empty array that we have created however this will only push uh the first two elements let me save this and if I run it you will see we only get the first chunk however we're not getting these other two so we need to repeat this and we need to a variable to keep track of the index right so Let's uh use a variable called index and set it uh to zero so instead of this zero we will use this variable okay and we need to repeat this code this line of code uh for all the elements of the array as long as there are elements in the array we need to keep on repeating this so for that we will use a loop uh so when you want to repeat a statement or code uh that's when you would use Loop so I'll use a while loop while index is less than the array. link as long as there are elements in our array we want to keep on executing this line of code right but this will run forever this will be an infinite Loop because we're not doing anything to make this uh stop right um and uh this will keep on running forever we will we need to increment the index we need to increment the index we need to make sure that when uh the index is greater than the array. length then it should uh exit the loop so how can we do that we will increment the index with size right and so this will start from zero to and the next time I would like to add a index with the size so that the next time it will get from two it will uh start from two to uh four right here but since in this example we don't have the uh fifth element which is going to be index of four we don't don't have that so it will um not this uh function will not take uh the slice function will not take the end as we read in the documentation so in that case we will have three and four so let's save this and run the code as you can see now we're getting the correct output so let me try to run it with this uh example and see if it is going to work for this yeah so we're getting the correct uh uh result and um that's the solution for this coding problem that's only one possible solution there are many ways of solving this problem if your solution is different than this then it's not a problem as long as you're getting the desired output we need to write a function that accepts a string the function should capitalize the first letter of each word in the string then return the capitalized string here are some examples I want you to open the five- tile case. JS exercise file and uh give this problem a try pause the video right here thank you for trying to solve this problem um every time I get a coding uh problem uh what I do is use the divide and concrete technique to divide the problem into very small uh problems so that it easier to find a solution so here the first thing that I think we need to figure out is uh to change uh the case for the strength to make it an uppercase so let me return um Str Str uh to upper case this is the function that we will call on the string to change the case so now you can see it's all capital letters right however we would need uh only the first letter of each word to be a capital not the whole sentence right so um what we need to do is to um to uh break this string to split this string into an array uh with each words and how can we do that so let me say const let me create a variable uh words and I will call uh split function on the string and I'll provide a space so what I will do is I will um split this string based on the spaces so this will uh become like something like this now that we have all the words what we can do is create um um create another variable called result right and set that into an empty array and we will capitalize each word and push it into this array and at the end we will just return this result okay and to do that we need to Loop over uh the words so we need to Loop over the string right with uh each word so uh we can use a for Loop for word of words so now we have access to each word and we want to push that result. push we want to push that word into this result array and so what do we want to do we want to get the first letter of the word and how can we do that like this so so for each word like the first time it uh Loops over you'll get this word so you'll get this word so the first letter that you can get it by you know like doing like this okay so this is the first word but we need the rest of this uh characters uh to be added to this word so how can we do that so we need to add that uh if you watched the last video you know how to use the slice function so what we will do is we will call A Slice on the word and we'll start from the first position all right as you can as you know that uh strings and arrays are zero index so so this would be 0 1 2 three so we got the first letter however we want to to add the rest of the letters so we'll start from the position one so it will take all of this and add it here right so once we um capitalize each word you will go the loop will go through each word each word like this one by one and capitalize the first letter and add the rest of the uh characters to the word and so we will have all the words in the array so let me save this and uh run the code you will see that okay so it's not been capitalized because we haven't called it to uppercase uh uppercase function on onto the first letter so let's do that and run the code again now as you you can see each word in this array is capitalized uh but this is inside of an array so we need to join join uh the elements in the array into the string based on the space right so I'll save this and run this again this is the correct output and this is how we capitalize the um sentence um and if you don't like creating a new array and adding it uh adding each word into that array and uh returning the result we can even uh minimize all of this work by using um uh map method um so we can call map on this words so uh we can get rid of all of this we can call the map function and we'll get access to each word right and the same way we will get access to um the word we'll get the first letter we'll change this to uppercase We'll add rest of uh whoops call the word we call Slice on on the word and add rest of the characters of the word and then we'll join with the space and return the result uh let's run it see this is another solution so you got two solution for this problem we no longer need this variable so we can remove this check to see if two provided strings are anagrams of each other one string is an anagram of another if it uses the same characters in the same quantity only consider characters not spaces or punctuation consider capital letters to be the same as lower case here are some examples if you provided two strings one coding money and the other money coding it should return true because it uses the same characters and the quantity of each character is the same therefore it returns true same is true for this other example rail safety and fairy tales are anagrams of each other because they use the same characters in the same quantity uh of characters are uh present in both of these uh strings we will not consider exclamation marks or um special characters or spaces um so uh this is the challenge for today uh pause the video and give this problem a try also if you want to follow along check out the GitHub repository at this URL all right so I'll give you two possible solutions to this coding problem um the first solution consists of three steps and the first step will build a character map for string a then we'll build a character map for string B and this in the third step we'll compare both of these character maps to see if they're equal to each other um if they're not we'll return false so let's start by building the character map for string a to do that we need an empty object let's create that let's call this car map a and set that to an empty object and also we need to remove uh space in uh punctuations uh exclamation marks and things like that so I'll do that now string a. to lower case and to remove the uh the punctuations in spaces we would we'll use a regular expression [Music] make sure to use uh backs slash capital W this will match um all the uh special characters um the space and punctuations um this is a a character set brackets represent the character set and this capital D represent anything that is not a word which is different than the small uh W if you use a small W it will match all uh the words that is in a character uh it will not match the punctuations so we'll use capital d to replace that okay so uh to show you um uh let's return uh this string a let me return it uh save this to see the output of um our clean [Music] uh string so as you can see um this is the string a it has space and exclamation marks uh but after this line of code it removed the exclamation mark in spaces and this is the output that we get all right so let's uh create uh now uh um the character map so um we'll use a for Loop so for let car of uh string a and uh so we'll say car map a. car let's see car map a if this character already exists if it exists then increment it by one if or if if it does not exist then I use one okay so this will create uh the character map for string a let me return it to see the output of what we get here so return C R map a save and run so you see we're getting the character map for string a uh so as you can see it's counting each characters for example we have one R 2 a 1 I one L so on so we created the character map um for string a we need to do the same thing the same exactly same steps uh there's a principle in uh software development uh do not repeat yourself so if I write the same code over here it's repeating myself writing the same code again and again so um at this point it is uh a good idea to create an hel uh method another function to uh um to create the character map so I'll call this new function function all call it character car map I'll call it car map um and it will have St strr and I'll just um what I'll do I'll copy this code I'll paste it here right so return car map uh so uh let's do something remove these things so that uh we can reuse use it with anything so I'm just going to uh change this to S strr because this is the variable that we're using here Str and then Str Str okay remove the a from here and so I'm going to save this uh what I'm going to do is here for correct map a I'm going to use Cor map and provide string a to this one string a and let me return this map a to to make sure it's working fine so yeah so this is working fine and the now the the best part is that we can reuse this to build a character map for string B so uh I can copy the the statement and paste it right here uh we I'll rename the variable call it B and here I'm just going to change string a to string B because this is what we're using as the parameter and now so we we have uh the character map uh we build the character map for both the uh string a and string B now we need to compare uh compare both of them first of all let's compare the length of uh um both the characters uh so to do that as you can see in an object we have keys and values as you can see R is the key and uh one is the value a is the key two is the value right um to um get the keys to get all the keys we can use um object. keys and we can provide U the string like that so let me return this return object. keys so that you see what would be the output now so if I return this uh object. Keys oh sorry I have to provide the car character map uh car map a so let me save it so so you see uh these are the keys it it returns all the keys uh for me from the uh object the character map of of string a so what I can do is I can uh compare both of them by using an F statement I can say object. keys provide car map a u uh and to find the length because this uh object. Keys convert uh into an array and then you get get uh the keys in an array so on the array we can use Link to to check the link and compare that with uh object. Keys car map B uh do length so if the length of these two um um keys do not match then then we'll return false right so if our uh character map a does not have the same uh Keys uh as the character map B then obviously we know that this is uh going to be false this is not going to be an anagram now we need to Loop uh both of these character Maps so we can Loop over over any of them we can either choose a or b it doesn't matter so I'll use um character map a so I'll say let key uh n uh car map a uh now you see that we're using n you see let key n uh when we working with objects and we want to Loop through the objects we use n and if it is an array then in that case we'll use off so now now we're using let key in character map a and then I'll use comparison I'll do if um car map a key is not equal to car map b key if the key in character map a is not equal to the key of the character map B uh for example if we have for example one R in character map a and we have two R in the character map a b and if they are not equal to each other then in in that case we know that this is not an anagram therefore we will return false right so if this check passes and this check passes and we can't find anything that is not equal to each other then it and it means that it is an anagram and both of the characters in character map A and B are equal uh so this means that we have an anagram so in that case um we will return true so let's save this and let's run the code to see if it is working or not as you can see this is not working uh why this should return true um why it is not working so it is returning false we have to find what is the reason so oh here this is a big mistake that I'm doing I am checking that if they're equal I should check if they're not equal so this should be like like this they should not be equal to this in in that case we would return false all right so let's uh save this and run the code it should give you the the correct output this time let's um try with another example so let me try with this all right let me save it this should return true the last test case let's try with this one copy paste save it okay and now it should return false this is uh working this is the first solution to the problem let's work on the the easier and and very intuitive uh solution to this problem all right let's work on the second solution I said I'll give you two solutions and the second solution is uh uh is much easier I'll show you one small little trick it will make it a piece of cake so let me copy this uh one for your future reference I'll copy the solution as well for you and I'll copy it I'll paste it here I'll comment it out okay and now let me get rid of this so now I'll just get rid of all of it right so now what we will do is we'll sort a string a and string B once it is sorted then we'll get the it will make it much easier right so let's do that uh so let's uh sort string a string a uh but you uh know that the S function is only possible on array it cannot be done in um on the string directly so we need to convert uh the string into an array but before doing doing that we need to uh change this to lowercase lower case and also we'll um do the regular expression the same regular expression uh that we did to get rid of the space and punctuations all right so once uh we got rid of that I will call split function split function on it and then once uh I have changed this to uh an array I can call the sort uh method and once it is sorted I will join it back like this so let me return this to see what we get let me save this return as you can see uh this is High there right so this is string a uh so we can do the same thing for string B so let's uh create another function to do this uh to make it easier because we know about the software development principle do not repeat yourself we do we will not repeat ourselves therefore we'll create a function uh I will call this function clean um Str Str and I'll provide this string uh as the parameter so what I'll do is I'll just uh cut this from here I'll paste it here return sorry return and instead of Str string we need to use the same uh input parameter name or the same thing like this okay so now we can do the same like we can return uh clean St Str provide a string a and compare this to clean Str Str string B so now when we do this uh we'll just compare this will this is a conditional uh statement um if it is true it will return true if it is false it will return false so let's also try with another example this one uh copy paste save run it we are getting the correct output uh this is uh the second solution as I as I promised to give you we need to write a function that returns number of vowels used in a string what's a vowel uh vs are the characters a e i o u here are some examples uh so we need to count the vowels um i e e so there are three vowels we need to return three and second example how are you we have five wows so we need to count the vowels uh in a given string uh pause the video give this problem a try all right so I'll give you two solutions to this problem uh I'll give you one solution with the regular Expressions that is the easiest and um a lot of interviewers might not like you to use the um uh the regular Expressions they may not allow you to do that so I'm going to give you another uh solution uh just in case so with the regular expression is very easy um so we have built-in function called match which we can call on string which is the provider string so we can call match and then we will provide a regular expression so what regular expression we will provide here we'll um use a character set of a e i o u right and then we need to provide two flags G and I why we providing G because uh by default if you do not have G over here it will stop at the first match that it finds for example if it finds a so it will only uh return the the first match when we have G it will not stop at the first match it will go for uh forward and it will find any character that matches uh the um letters in this character set and the I is for case insensitivity so it will become insensitive to the case even if it is a capital letter it will still work so so um this one the match uh method returns um null if uh there are no matches if uh there are any match it will return an array with all the matches so uh therefore what we'll do is create a uh variable called matches and uh and store the result of the matches inside this uh matches variable and we'll return matches if there are matches we will return the length we don't want to return the match because as you can see in the examples we just need to return the count of those vowels so we'll just use a length because on arrays we can run we have a property uh called length and it will return uh the length of that array and if there are no matches we can return zero so in that case uh uh I'll save this and I run it as you can see for coding money uh the in the example we have this is returning the correct result so this was the first solution with the regular expression all right let's work on the second solution to this problem uh so the idea is we'll create an array with all the vowels inside it so um then we will check the strength against uh the values in the array uh to see if we can find a match if there's a match we will use the counter variable to increment and then at the end we'll return that counter variable so uh let's try to do that so let's create um an array called uh um um vowel check and so what I'm going to do let's try to copy from here so I'm just going to copy the vowels and this array so now we have all the vowels uh right uh oops sorry I try to use the camel case uh okay so now I also need a variable called count and I'm going to set that to zero uh and then I'm going to uh run a loop for uh let um car of s strr okay I'm going to have a logic inside of this Loop and at the the end I'll return the count what I'll do inside of this loop I will check to see if the characters in The String is a vowel if it is a vowel I'm going to increment the count variable if it is not a Val it not do anything and so at the end we'll just return the count okay uh so the loop goes uh each character one by one like this right so in this example we have coding money it um the first uh iteration it will check for C then uh o d i n g so um I'll say um uh so the arrays have a built-in helper um function called includes um that's also available on this strength but in our case it's better to use an an array it's more structured and organized so we can say um if vowel check do includes okay if the vowel check includes the character from the string so if it includes character so in the first iteration C if is C inside of this array if it is uh um uh uh if it is not then it will just um skip uh this line if and the second iteration it will come to O So it will uh check to see if o is inside of the vowel check if it is then we will increment the count variable so at the end we will return the count so let me run it and the example we should get the four so let's see as you can see we're getting the correct result this is another solution to this problem uh one more thing before you go uh you can just add uh two lower over here uh to make sure even if the provided string has uh capital letters or small letters it will still match our JavaScript training algorithms for beginners would not be complete without the classic fizzbuzz challenge you need to write a program that console logs the numbers from one to n but for the multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz for the numbers which are multiples of both three and five print fiz Buzz here's an example uh I would like you to try this problem and pause the video right here thank you for trying to solve this problem I hope you were able to find a solution if you did not this doesn't matter we'll work on it together the whole trick to solving this problem is using the module operator if you haven't use that before we'll use it right away okay of course we need a loop right so we'll start from one I let let I equal to 1 because it's given in the directions and the condition that we need to satisfies I less than or equal to n and then I ++ okay so the first thing that we would need to do is to check for if the number is a multiple of five and three if it is uh so how to check if a number is a multiple of uh three we use the module operator so we can say I uh the module operator is the person sign um if I is um if I modu 3 equals to uh zero it means that if the um if I is divisible by three completely and it does not have any remainders then it means this number is a multiple of three okay and so I also need to check if I is um um a multiple of five if if I is divisible by five and it does not have any remainders then in that case we need to write phase Buzz right else if if I is um multiple of three and if I is divisible by three and it does not have any remainder after the division then it it means that this is also we use the module operator every time if you need to do like for example every third time or every second time in in a repetition uh so that's how like I'll show you uh now in the example okay so in that case if it is um multiple of three we need to print phase so console. line pH else if I is multiple of five we need to write Buzz console. [Music] L else console. L the number I okay let me save this and run the code as you can see I provided the number five here to the function and as you can see that I have the number one two and then it says phiz and then I have four and then it says Buzz okay let me try with a bigger number like 20 okay let me save it and run the code as you can see so like I said if a number is a m multiple of three then it means then it means that it will repeat every third time you see this is the third you know every third time we have fiz every fifth time we have buzz and every time that the number is divisible by three and five and there is no remainer to to that number like for example 15 we write fiz buuz okay that's the solution to the classic fbus challenge we need to write a function that accepts a positive number n the function should console log a step shape with n levels using the pound character make sure the step has spaces on the right hand side here are some examples the uh function accepts and number and if we provided with number two this should be the output okay so give this problem a try and uh pause the video right here all right thank you for trying to solve this problem if you were able to find a solution that's great if not it doesn't matter we will work on this problem together I think first uh we need to focus on printing something like this uh it would be easier for us to print something like this and then we will worry about the spaces later let's do this one and then we'll take it from there uh as you might have already guessed we need a loop so I'll write the for loop I uh equals to 1 I less than or equal to n i++ okay so one thing um I've noticed the beginners are confused about whether they should start from one or zero if they want to start from zero then I'll make sure that the condition is I less than n but if they want to start from one then the condition has to be I less than or equal to n so that's important to note uh for now I'm just going to console log the pound sign I'm going to save it and uh run it as you can see we get the three pounds uh but we need nine uh pound symbols three on each line okay so um to do that uh we would need to use a nested loop I noticed that the beginner developers find working with the um uh nested Loops uh difficult they struggle with it I'm going to give you way uh to make it easier if you visualize uh what you want to do in terms of uh a table containing rows in columns it makes it a lot easier uh so let's uh try to do that uh I'm going to rename my variable I'll change it to row and then I will create nested Loop and I'll make this a column so the nested Loop the outer loop will be responsible for the row and the enter Loop will be responsible for creating all the columns in that row so if you think about it this way then it would be much easier to work with the nested Loops from now on okay so let's console log here just to show you what you get as the output as you can see you're we're getting 8 pound symbols in the output uh but we would we need only uh three pounds on each line so it's it's going to be a 3X3 uh pound symbols um and we need that in the output okay so how to do that okay uh so I want to create all the columns I mean I will I want to create an empty variable called line I will set it to empty string and what I'm going to do I'm going to append app bend the pound symbol to this line so after it completes it adds the pound symbol for all of the columns for that row I want to um console log. line okay let me save this and run as you can see we're getting the desired output right all right so the best way to visualize the code that I've written here so far uh by debugging it so let me run the debugger I have set a breakpoint on the first Loop let me uh let me watch for some variables let me watch for row and call and line okay and let's run this okay so the outer loop starts at one and then we initialize the variable line to empty uh string and then it uh executes the enter Loop it starts the enter loop at uh one column one and then it appens the uh the pound symbol to the line variable uh then it will increment uh the column to two and then uh it will append another pound as you can see and then it increments to column three and since we're provided with a number n you see n is3 so now we know that the uh inner loop will break H and so the row will increment now we will working on the second row and then again we initialize the line to an empty strength and then the enter Loop will run three times to a pent three pound to the line and then we'll uh console log the second line now we're working with the third line in the loop and um and it initialize the line and then we're appending the pound sign to to the line and then once row is equal to four um it um the condition becomes false so it U you know exits the loop so this is uh the code when you have trouble understanding a code it's always a good idea to debug it okay so now we we have we know what this is doing now we need to take care of the spaces on the right side um we need to do what let's let me illustrate that what we need to do here so we need to remove replace the for the first line we need to have two spaces on the second line we need to have one space now we need to work on getting an output like this um it will be easier for me to explain this uh on the Blackboard uh so let's get on the Blackboard all right so whenever we're working with the nested Loops it's always best to visualize it in terms of a table in rows in columns it makes it much easier to work with the problem so let's see on which columns do we have the pound symbol right we need to figure that out we have a here column one row one we have it column one uh row two um as you can see this is 1 is equal to one um column one one is less than two let's see here uh column uh two um row two we know that 2 is equal to two right and let's see this one this column three row three we can see that 3 is equal to 3 um just by looking at this we know that all the columns that have the pound symbol satisfy this condition column is either less or equal to the row all right since we figured out the condition Logic the code is easy uh so here we'll say f [Music] column is less than or equal to row then append this line append pound to the line else append [Music] space let's save it and run the code as you can see we're getting the res desired output this is the solution to the problem let's try with another number like let's try with six [Music] oops as you can see we're getting the correct uh string pattern we need to write a function that accepts a positive number n the function should console log a paramed shape with n levels using the pound character make sure the paramid has spaces on both the left and the right hand side here are some of the examples as you as you can see that it has spaces on the right and left hand side of the pound symbol whenever there's needed okay so I would like you to give this problem a try pause the video right here as you might have probably guessed we need a loop right we as you can see if the number that's provided is three we need three rows right so we need to um uh write a loop um like I mentioned in the video uh before this one uh that whenever you're working with the nested Loops is best to visualize them in the form of a table consisting of rows and columns it makes the problem so much easy uh so let me write uh the for Loop let row equals to zero um row less than n um row Plus+ that's easy right so we need three rows and for each line you see this is one line uh I'm calling each row a line right so I'm going to need an empty string so I'm going to uh um create a variable called line and I'm going to set it to um an empty string now we need uh to Loop over the columns let column equal to zero and uh column uh less than okay so we need to figure out the number of columns because it's uh as you can see for if the number is three we need five columns so uh let's hop on to the black board real quick okay so what do we need to figure out is the number of columns because number of rows is clear for if n is equal to two we have two rows if n is equal to three we have three rows right the number of columns if it is 2 N - one does this satisfy the number of columns so if the number is three uh two multiply 3 is 6 - 1 is equal to 5 so this satisfy the number of columns so now we can easily write our Inner Loop and we can write it like um let me select the same color for let column equals to zero column is less than 2 N -1 column Plus+ right so now we need to figure out which columns do we need to put the pound symbol in right so if you look at it uh we know that the midal column always has the pound symbol so let's figure out the formula to find the metal column so if we have five columns and we divide it divide that by two we get 2.5 and if we round down this number we get two right and you can see that the two column has all of it has the pound symbol okay we have a method called math. floor and and to get the number of columns we already know that it is 2 n-1 and we divide that by two we get uh the mid point we figured out the midpoint now we know that there's a few of the pound sign on the right side of the midpoint and there are a few of the pound sign on the left side of the midpoint so if you see this uh carefully and You observe it you will figure out that uh all the columns that have the pound symbol satisfy this condition and the condition is column is either greater than or equal to Mid minus row and Callum column is less than or equal to Med Plus okay so now that we have figured that out it is so much easy to write the code so let's uh hop on the visual study code and write the code for this one all right so as I've explained to you on the Blackboard we now know the number of uh columns that is two n min-1 and then we get a column Plus+ all right and we also know the condition um to use uh for uh you know determining which column should have the pound symbol and that is if right if uh column is greater than or equal to uh mid uh midpoint minus row and column is less than midpoint uh less than or equal to midpoint plus row all right so we need to uh we don't have a variable mid uh we need to create that here I'm going to use the mad. floor and 2 N - 1 / 2 all right okay and now uh if um this condition is set satisfied we know that we need to append the pound symbol if not we need to append space okay and right after this enter Loop ends uh we need to console log uh the line let me save this and run it cannot mix big in in other types use explicit conversion so I'm getting an error let's see what error is this I know what the problem is we need to multiply 2 multiply by n minus one and that's the same thing we need to do over here we need to multiply this uh like like this 2 multip by n minus one right so let me save this and run this again as you can see I'm getting the correct output this time um and let me try with another let's try with nine let me save it and run it as you can see we're getting a bigger paramet this time time and this codee is working perfectly I've had dreams that weren't just dreams today we need to write a function that accepts an integer n and returns that n byn spiral metric here are some examples if you're provided with an input number three we need to return a two-dimensional array with the values uh in the same order as one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 I'd like you to give this problem a try and pause the video right here this is not an easy problem I would say this is a medium to a hard problem uh if you were not able to find a solution to this problem that is very normal I was struggling with this problem the first time I tried uh but once you get the trick uh problems like this become so much easy um okay so as you can see we uh need to define a few variables like start row end row start column end column and we would need a counter variable and um also we would need to take care of the for side uh the top row we would need one Loop for the top row uh another loop for the right column the another loop for the bottom row and another loop for the left column once we so we we we would need at least four loops and once we take care of the outer uh you know the four sides outer sides uh we would need to put the four Loops inside a while loop to take care of all the inner uh four sides of the Matrix right so our first Loop would go from start column to end column and this would take care of the top R right and once we do this we would increment the start row by one so it will move down here um and then we would need another loop that would go from start row to end row and that would take care of the uh right side at the right column all right and once we do this we decrement the end column so we decrement the end column it will come over here and then we need another loop that would go from end column to start column and it would take care of the bottom uh row and once the bottom row is complete we would decrement the end row so it will come over here here and then we would uh finally run a loop from end row to start row that would take care of the left side uh the left column of uh The Matrix and then once we write this these four Loops we need to put them inside the Y Loop and the Y Loop would take care of the inner four sides so once you know this the coding becom so much easy so let's start coding I'll start off by creating a variable called result I'll set that to empty array and we need to return an uh multi-dimensional array so uh to create create that we need to run a for Loop for I equal to0 I less than n i++ result. push empty array return result let me run this code to say yes we are getting four empty arrays inside of this array because the number that is provided as the input is four okay so we need to have four rows in The Matrix we uh but these are empty we need to fill them with values and once we're done at the end we will return the result okay and so we need to take care of the four sides top right bottom left top right bottom left okay um to create this top row we need to run a loop uh from uh but first we need to create some uh variables the variables that we need to Define or counter I'll set that to one start row I'll set that to zero and row N minus1 start call equals to Zer and call is n minus one okay so for the top row we need to start for let I equals to start call I less than or equal to end call i++ make sure you have semic colums here and result okay so the first value that you'll provide will be for the row and the second values are going to be for the column okay since uh the the values for the columns are going to be dynamic and it will be coming from I but we know that the top row is start row so I'll do start row equal to the counter and then I will increment the counter like this let me save this and run it okay as you can see the top row is done so we need to increment the start row okay like it comes here okay let's do this the same thing for the right side this time it will be start row because it's going to be vertical comes from the top uh to the bottom row so it will be uh start row uh end row I ++ this time the value for the row will be dynamic but we know that the column that needs the values changed are going to be the end column we're going to be adding the values to the end column so and at the end once this end column is done we will uh decrement the end column so it's going to be end call minus minus I'll save it I'll run it as you can see the top row and the right column is done let's take care of the bottom row so for the bottom row let me copy this one so for the bottom row as you know that we will start from the end row uh end column and I is greater than or equal to greater than or equal to the start column and we need to decrement the value of I the values of the column is going to be dynamic but we know that since it's going to be the bottom row so it is going to be the end row and once that is done uh we will decrement the end row like that okay let me run this to see it's working fine so the top right side and the bottom uh row is done so we need to take care of the left side so for this one for this one we knew that it's going to go from end row end row it's uh start row uh we know that the values for the rows is going to be dynamic but the values for uh the column is going to be start call and once that is done we will increment the start column like this so let's run this one okay so the four sides are done one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 right so we need to put these four Loops inside of a while loop to take care of all the inner uh four sides of the Matrix so let me copy the four Loops that we wrote over here I'm going to cut it and here I'm going to write a while loop while start row is less than or equal to end row and start column is less than or equal to end column while this condition is true you know execute this code within the body of the Y Loop which are the four Loops it will keep on looping until it reaches the end of the row and end of the column so let me save this and run the code as you can see we are getting the desired output and it's going into the right direction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 let's try with another number like six and run the code we are getting the bigger Matrix with the correct values now you're ready to start my lead code video series you should find link

      "[Document(page_content=\"in this video I'm going to explain all the core Technologies you need to learn to become a backend developer my name is Bo KS and I've created many courses about backend development for the freec camp.org YouTube channel you can learn a lot from this video on its own but it also serves as an introduction to a massive curriculum that will teach you every technology I talk about in detail each week we publish a lot of content on the freec camp.org YouTube channel and new people sometimes wonder where to start and what order to watch the courses well if you want to become a backend developer this is where to start this is our back-end developer road map we've created a collection of top-notch courses on all of the key Technologies you need to learn and you can watch them right here on our Channel for free so let's start by defining what backend development is a backend developer is a type of programmer who focuses on creating the underlying logic and serers side software that powers websites and applications their primary resp responsibilities include serers side logic they write the code that runs on web servers which handles the business logic of an application this includes processing user requests interacting with databases and controlling the flow of data between the server and the front end of the website or application database management backend developers are often responsible for Designing implementing and maintaining databases they manage and manipulate the data that's stored in these databases ensuring its integrity and security API development they often create application programming interfaces or apis which allow different software applications to communicate with each other these apis are crucial for the integration of different systems and for enabling front-end applications to access serers side functions and data server management they may also be involved in configuring and managing the servers where the applications run this can include setting up cloud-based servers managing server resources and securing uptime and performance sec security ensuring the security of the web application is a key part of a back-end developer's job this includes protecting against various types of cyber threats securing data and implementing authentication and authorization schemes becoming a backend developer typically begins with acquiring a strong foundation in computer science the core of this Learning Journey involves mastering serers side programming languages such as python Java JavaScript nodejs and.net and getting expertise database management with systems like SQL MySQL postresql or mongodb additionally familiarity with server management cloud services and containerization Technologies is increasingly important practical skills can be further developed through personal projects internships or contributing to open source projects continuously learning and staying updated with all the latest technological Trends as well as engaging with the developer community are crucial for anyone who wants to be successful as a backend developer so here are some of the essential Technologies you need to learn you can watch a full comprehensive course on each of these Technologies right here on the freec camp.org YouTube channel as part of this backend learning path understanding the basics of the internet is crucial for backend developers this includes knowledge of how data is transmitted over the Internet how DNS work and the roles of protocols such as HTTP and https a solid grasp of these fundamentals allows backend developers to build more efficient and secure applications there are many programming languages used for backend development one is Javascript JavaScript was once confined to the browser but now it's become one of the most popular languages for backend development thanks to environments like node.js its asynchronous nature and event-driven model make it suitable for developing scale aable and high performance applications python is renowned for its readability and efficiency making it an excellent choice for backend development its vast ecosystem of libraries and Frameworks such as jeno and flask allow for Rapid development of applications across various domains and there are a lot of other commonly used languages for backend development such as PHP and Java git is a version control system that allows Developers to track and manage changes to their codebase GitHub is a web-based platform which leverages git and enables developers to collaborate on projects review code and manage changes understanding git and GitHub is essential for backin developers to maintain code integrity and collaborate effectively with others relational databases store data in tables which can be linked to each other through relationships knowledge of relational database management system systems like MySQL post SQL or Oracle is vital for backend developers to design query and manage data efficiently ensuring data integrity and performance application programming interfaces or apis allow different software systems to communicate with each other backin developers must understand how to create manage and document apis as they enable the front end to interact with the back end fetch data and perform operations knowledge of restful services and graphql is particularly valuable caching is a technique to store copies of data in a temporary storage area which helps in reducing the load on the backend system decreasing latency and improving the performance of web applications backend developers need to understand where and how to implement caching strategies effectively API security is Paramount to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access backend developers should be familiar with best practices such as implementing authentication authorization data encryption rate limiting and regular security audits to safeguard the apis testing is critical to ensure the reliability and functionality of backend code developers should be proficient in various testing methodologies including unit testing integration testing and in end testing to detect and fix bug improve code quality and enhance the stability of the application understanding software design and architecture is crucial for creating scalable maintainable and efficient backend systems this includes knowledge of design patterns architectural Styles and principles that guide the structuring of software systems for better performance and scalability message Brokers like rabbit mq and Kafka facilitate communication between different parts of an application through a reliable asynchronous messaging system they're essential for building distributed systems enabling decoupling of application components enhancing scalability and improving fault tolerance containerization Technologies like Docker and kubernetes are essential for creating deploying and managing applications in an isolated consistent and scalable environment Docker packages applications into containers while kubernetes orchestrates these containers managing their life cycle across multiple environments engine X is a popular web server known for its high performance stability and efficient resource usage backend developers should understand how to configure engine X to serve static files proxy requests and handle load balancing which is crucial for building scalable and reliable web applications graphql is a query language for a apis that allows clients to request exactly the data they need making it an efficient alternative to traditional rest apis backin developers should understand how to implement graphql servers to provide flexible and efficient data access mongodb is a nosql database that stores data in flexible Json like documents allowing for fluid data models and Rapid development it's particularly useful for applications that require scalability fast querying and the ability to handle a variety of data types Firebase provides a comprehensive Suite of tools for building web and mobile applications including real-time databases authentication and hosting it's favored for Rapid development and its ability to scale automatically making it a popular choice for startups and agile projects reddis is an inmemory data structure store used as a database cache and message M broker its high performance and support for various data structures such as strings hashes and lists make it invaluable for scenarios requiring fast access to data such as caching understanding the underlying infrastructure is crucial for backend developers this includes knowledge of servers networks cloud services and how they interconnect to deliver applications familiarity with Cloud providers like AWS Azure or Google cloud and services like virtual machines container orchestration and serverless Computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and scalability of applications backend development is a constantly shifting and involving landscape with new technologies emerging and best practices being refined regularly keeping up with these changes and remaining adaptable is essential in this field this road map lays a solid foundation but the Journey of learning and growth in back and development is continuous there are numerous popular tools and Frameworks not included in this road map however starting somewhere is important and the Technologies I've mentioned are an excellent beginning Point engage actively with the developer Community experiment with emerging tools and always aim for excellence in your work the realm of backend development has many opportunities with the right set of skills and knowledge you can develop powerful efficient and secure backend systems so good luck on your Learning Journey\", metadata={'source': 'tN6oJu2DqCM', 'title': 'Back End Developer Roadmap

      "[Document(page_content=\"[Music] welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast each week we talk with developers entrepreneurs and ambitious people who are getting into Tech this week I'm joined by Cassidy Williams AKA cassid do Hello thank you for having me yeah we're thrilled to have you here cassid where does that name come from that's your handle on Twitter and Tik Tok and all the things uh it came from my mom actually she would say like how do you do cassad do and I picked it as a username in college and it just kind of stuck everywhere awesome awesome yeah and everywhere indeed that's one of the things I want to just start off by talking about like how you are ubiquities I can't really even think of any developers who are on more platforms and and like putting out more stuff than you so just some quick background on Cassidy she's been a developer for more than a decade she's worked at tons of big companies she's worked at lots of small companies as well she's currently the CTO of a tech startup uh so yeah let's talk about all these places you are so you I guess my first exposure to you was maybe like four or five years ago like watching the short kind of Tik Tok videos and hearing about this developer who was like Making Waves on Tik Tok on the talk right I don't use Tik Tok myself uh I watch Like These two or three hour long video essays on YouTube and stuff but uh certainly a lot of people were sharing it and it was also making its way onto Twitter and like Reddit and places like that that I would normally see it so maybe you can talk about like content creation and like how you became so prolific with your crazy you know Dad joke humor my memes yeah your memes yeah yeah and so I feel like I always made memes but Tik Tok just made it easier to make more um where I I even loved making videos a ton just when I was young but video editing takes time uh as you probably know and so I I kind of stopped but it was always like a fun thing that I did um and then yeah when I when I got Tic Tac I was like wow this editor is so easy and I just started recording silly ones that I had ideas for back in I think it was like mid 2019 when I started and things kind of exploded from there I never intended to be a content creator it was just kind of me joking around about the state of development and went from there yeah so maybe talking a little bit about content Creation in general like what are some of the cassid do memes that people may have seen like the the short videos like is there one that it just like completely blew up that you were like wow like I had no idea this many people would appreciate this developer humor yeah I think this was like the second or third one I made where it was me singing the song Impossible from a Cinderella movie where it's just someone repeating impossible a bunch of times and it's when your code works on the first try and it was just a bunch of people going like impossible impossible and it just keeps repeating it and it's true because you should always be suspicious if your code just works on the first try it's also you're also like o I'm a genius but also I'm probably not what's going on um so I think that one related a lot and then I also uh I do a Halloween Tik Tok every year where I admit I don't make as many as I do as I did before because I just have less time but I still always do one on Halloween where I do a CSS trick and I hide the word boo somewhere in the Tik Tok at some point and uh as you do the CSS trick the word boo appears and I scream at the end that that one I feel like a lot of people they're just like I look forward to this one every year because I can't figure out what it is until I see it and so that one's pretty fun too yeah interesting so you kind of like recurring uh themes and Rec even like recurring kind of inside jokes from the cassid C Universe yeah there there's some where I definitely it's like such a specific joke where I'm just like hm there's maybe 10 people in the world who will actually get this joke but it's funny to me so I'm going to do it anyway where like one of them was very specifically a reference to the Dream Girls Musical and then if you know that Musical and the lyrics that I am singing in there and you know react and how the use effect hook works it's a really funny joke and it like combines the two of them but yeah there the people who got it they're like oh my gosh this is so specific but this is hilarious and then everyone else is like good job you know that the definitely a lot of them are Hit or Miss but it's it's fun to just kind of laugh at a very serious industry sometimes like as a very amateurish dad joke and I only do it among family you're not going to see me trying to crack dad jokes generally in like the free C Camp newsletter or on the free C Camp podcast or right anywhere where you get your weekly do Quincy Larson right um I am very scared of just like getting the Crickets effect because I was like too many references deep and like at what point does a joke become too esoteric and you're like I really don't have confidence that this is going to land with even like one out of every 10 people that like do you have like some heuristics that you use when I just make the joke anyway cuz if I'm laughing at it I know that I can have a good time and and like there there's some specific people who like my husband or my sister or something they will all they will always be just like oh my gosh that was dumb but I know exactly what you're referencing and so like I I I've got a few people in in my back pocket where I can be like you'll laugh at this and then most people where they're just like no Cassidy I'm okay with that I just kind of make the joke anyway yeah so to some extent like you can be your own barometer of relevance and trust that your life is experience is overlapped with enough other people that like you know you've got some audience out there that is going to appreciate it and sometimes like the most geeky if I can use that term like of humor it brings people together who feel like I thought I was the only one who was interested in Doctor Who and right or who had this experience or something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly or like greatest showman in typescript or something like that like yeah you you never know who it might work for and at the same time if anything future me will laugh at the joke and so I I make the joke anyway awesome yeah that's a great Philosophy for being is just like I have faith that other people are going to be similar enough to me in some specific way that like it'll it'll work out I want to talk so I mean there's so many things we can talk about because there's just so many interesting Dimensions to you uh but one thing that is really interesting is just the extent to which you put yourself out there there are plenty of people who got a CS degree a computer science degree from like a good Public University here in the US and got good jobs at developers maybe got an uh internship in Microsoft right those coveted internships in big Tech that you got as a university student and they're just like cool I'm set I can write my own ticket I can get on the train and just enjoy my hobbies and work you know a reasonable amount of work and you know eventually retire and I can just be a professional Dev like I I suspect a lot of people go into like Fields like Dentistry or medicine or maybe even law just because they are remunerative stable careers where people are always going to have cavities you know like dentist are not going to go yeah yeah they'll always have teeth maybe they won't always have cavities but get the nanites in there cleaning the teeth for us but um a lot of people choose CS precisely because it's a stable income if they're like a first generation American or second generation and and they've got a lot of family to take care of like yeah uh for example a significant chunk of the Indian economy historically has been doctors Engineers people that are living in the United States who are making a lot of money and then remitting a lot of that back to their families their extended families I'm married to an immigrant so that's very real yeah I am too uh my wife uh uh she actually immigrated after we met in graduate school and we got married uh almost 20 years ago and then we moved back to the us and we went through the lengthy Green Card process and then the naturalization process she's a US citizen today uh but but yeah like I could totally understand if you're coming from that perspective of you didn't grow up you know middle class in like New York City or Los Angeles or something and you don't really have a lot to fall back on just getting a safe career like frankly being a developer is basically the safest career you can get in this sense that like I always like to say the Act of automating things is the last thing that will be completely automated and software Engineers are doing the automation so by definition like they'll be that's the last job that will ever exist probably right um but you have not rested on your laurels and you have not just checked out and just focused on you know living the good life and and making a lot of money as a developer and having cool creative you know self-actualizing work you've gone out there and you know put your reputation and like all this stuff on the line by attempting to make funny jokes on the internet where people might be mean to you right yeah what what drove you to do that so it wasn't so much me just being like I'm going to be funny and who cares what people say I think it was more just I a lot of the stuff that I do put out there I want to make Tech more accessible in general and so like I have a Weekly Newsletter and every single week I share like weekly links and a practice coding question and with the jokes I want Tech to not be as scary because honestly it's a very very serious industry that like you deal with certain bugs and you might think I'm the only one who's dealt with this and you're not like whe whether it's the paranoia of your manager calling you into a meeting or just your code not working on the first try or you suddenly saying like oh I I'll never be interested in some language and then you try it you're like wait I am it's amazing and and there there there's so many different things where uh I think especially in the pandemic so many people were very very isolated and uh a lot of the work that I've done it started pre- pandemic but continued and and I went a bit harder on it to try to provide resources to people that I wish I had when I was learning yeah so that that's a big idus is like I want to make sure people have resources that I wish I had when I was learning yeah I mean it's very similar to free obviously like I learned code you can probably relate yeah um so was that the main reason is just like because a lot of the things you're doing like you're putting out learning resources and you know I would consider you an educator even though it sounds like you're mainly like an I mean you're I guess uh you worked in developer myself as an educator too so yeah yeah so I guess what were your roots in wanting to do that of course you start with this abstract goal I want to make it easier for people who are going through a journey similar to my own what what were the early days of content creation Cassidy like yeah content creation Cassidy who is she um I first started let's let me think I guess when I was in college I that's when I started doing things like uh being a TA for people or or a peer mentor for for people when I say ta teacher assistant and kind of just helping other students and stuff and um even earlier than that uh I we're going way back in high school when I was first getting interested in coding and stuff and there was no free code camp or anything like that at that point for me where I was just kind of like blindly trying to code uh and learn things I got involved with an organization called ncwit the national Center for Women and it and they were so helpful not so much to be just like this is how you code but like they got me connected to a lot of people who are so helpful to be just like this is something you should know or or like this is this is a thing that you should talk about or this is a thing that you should remember um just mentors even if it was just a a one hour mentorship session or or just something in passing and I think just being engaged with them from an early age just because I truly randomly saw their website and I was like I should try to apply for a SC um it it kind of just snowballed from there where uh one of the mentors that I had said lift as you climb where just as you move up in the industry you should try to lift other others up with you um and because as you move up in your role or somewhere there's going to be someone filling in the space behind you at all times and and it just benefits everyone over time um and yeah I think that was just something that hit me hard early and I kind of just rolled with it where after being super involved in high school and in college with NC Wht and I still am to this day not as much as I used to be but I do like resume workshops with them and stuff um it it just kind of snowballed where I was like oh well now that I'm in college I can give talks to high school students so that way they know like what to major in in college and I wrote blogs for my college to on like what the computer science major is like and then I started to like do aot of networking and meeting with people especially at internships and stuff in college and then from there as I got to see people in the industry before graduating I saw so many people where they were coding but they weren't just coding and I was like you know I like the idea of coding but not just coding and seeing what that could be and that led me to start doing Dev advocacy and stuff and the again it kind of just snowball where from there I was just like okay I'll go to hackathons and be a mentor okay and then from there I'll speak at conference and maybe teach some people things and then I started teaching online classes and I first started my newsletter because I thought oh I could teach people on the side of my online classes promote my online classes but then also help people out and so it just kind of kept growing over time where it it started with people helping me and then me realizing I should help others as well wow yeah it it sounds like you had uh a lot of people that were very inspiring to you and that you got hooked up early on with people who were kind of in your corner and could relate to a lot of the challenges you were facing and uh that I love what you said like lift as you climb that's such an amazing like I mean makes sense from like a rock climbing thing like you might have two people that are tethered together and like so you you climb up and and they're there to like help you in case you fall like they're provide some security because they're also connected to the wall and stuff I mean I've never G there's so many people where they probably don't realize the impact that they had on me where it was just like one person was an upper classman just at my school where where she was just helpful enough I was just like okay I'm going to listen to what she said and and the sometimes you never know like what small pieces of advice will hit and then carry you on and and that uh that kind of stuff I want to be able to provide advice that I wish I had um to as many people as I can yeah yeah and it sounds like you're reaching a lot of people just to put things in context like the degree of impact you're having uh not just as a developer not just as a CTO developer Advocate but creating courses teaching people how to code um you've got a ton of people of course watching your Tik Tok videos and by extension you know the videos are cross posted on Twitter I often see them like like you've got the pinned C locks oh yeah I encourage everybody to check out the the link to Cassidy's Twitter uh Cassidy's Twitter in the uh in the show notes because uh just checking out that one it's just you play all these different characters and and that's one of the things I don't know if that's like a Tik Tok thing but it'll be like one person playing like all these different roles and uh maybe they're wearing uh like a hat in one or they're wearing many wigs I I I think wigs are so fun and so I'm just like this is a good opportunity to just have a different hat yeah I mean it's it's like a campy way of so economizing like because you don't need to get more people involved you can really DIY it you can literally be this sole writer producer director actress like actor all all those different things in the show and you don't need really anybody's permission to do anything and then you just have like the editing tools you make it and then you you Syndicate it across all these different things of course you've got your newsletter that I'll like I enjoyed reading some of the back issues of it always includes a joke it's worth signing up just for the joke definitely just read it to scroll to the joke yeah yeah I mean at least they're reading it and getting some uh benefit from it yeah yeah hey if anything what's fun is I I used to only do Tech jokes or or like most of them would be Tech jokes but then a bunch of people started saying like thank you so much for these jokes I read it to my grandma every week and I'm just like oh my gosh I'm going to do non- Tech jokes so you can read more to your grandma but uh yeah the jokes are great yeah uh like free C Camp my email every week includes a quote of the week and and recently of course I quoted one of your quotes about like some joke you made about get and uh it it was something about like I don't want to misquote it do you remember I honestly I literally wrote a blog post about get like a half hour before this recording so it could be anything yeah there are lots of like uh puns that you can make around get especially because I I think like there's so many weird mixed analogies in get and so many of the commands it's like like how did you go like get blamed that was a real head scratcher like such a rude way blame someone yeah I I saw someone made like an alias where it was get props and it's the same thing as blame it just makes you feel a little better about it yeah the toxicity of tech is built right into the tools themselves blaming people though um yeah I uh so you also stream on Twitch and I'd be curious to learn I haven't actually watched any of your streams yet I'm hoping to catch them like I don't spend a lot I watch vods on um YouTube that people upload video on demand so I never watch I watch everything on YouTube like double speed it twitch it's just like onx is too slow for me like no offense if anybody here is like finding this conversation dragging a little bit just go and bump the speed a little bit and I promise it's like way more everything is more interesting at 2x um and I do that for all my podcasts like basically every piece of content my wife won't even watch movies with me anymore CU I double speed them um oh gosh movies too sometimes you know it depends on like if it's like you know like a a late night kind of like guilty pleasure like watch of some 8s or a really really really slow movies where it's like we're walking across the sand Blade the new Blade Runner one was slow as heck um it was a good movie but it was slow like man AB some respectful people's time I'm sure like all the the you know filmmakers in the audience are like crying don't you yeah but anyway I do stream yeah talk about that yeah so I and I admit I've slowed down a little bit because I had a baby and it's not as easy to live stream weekly but I've been trying to get back to my regular weekly Cadence of streaming and it kind of started where once again I I thought it might be useful to teach people something and then kind of talk about it and so typically what I would do when I first started streaming um myself I had streamed before like with my sister and stuff Tech things but um I I would talk for like a half hour to an hour about like whatever questions people had jobwise or or technical questions opinions about the latest hot new JavaScript library or something like that and then after that I'd go into some project that was like recurring weekly and everything and I admit I leaned more towards the first part because people were so they had so many questions um for a while until a lot of my stream ended up being mostly just like a Q&A session seeing what like what questions can answer for people or just hang out and co-work um but then yeah some other ones where it's I'll be like I really want to work on this library today so I'm just going to code and I'll check out the chat and see if yall have questions from there but yeah it's it's a very casual stream I I admit I should probably be more like consistent about it there have been times where I'm just like I'm not streaming this week because I have a really good sandwich here's a picture of it see you next week and so like it really just varies from from week to week but uh yeah it's it's fun to just kind of chat with people in the community especially once again it's a very remote World um especially uh post pandemic we're still kind of in it eh um and and being able to interact with people in the community yeah yeah so being out there especially like real time communicating with chat and uh as you're on stream like doing Q&A sessions or just live coding and answering people's questions as they fire them in uh I did stream for like a couple years years uh while I was building a lot of the early versions of free Cod camp but it just um I got some the same question so many times over and over I'm like I'm just going to write articles and writing articles like I I got a lot more I guess help helped a lot of people more a lot definitely I I have like an ask me anything repo on GitHub you can go to cast. run um I I have like an ask me anything repo where it's like frequently asked questions and then also yeah if I get a question repeatedly I'm just like okay I'll write a blog and then I can just kind of link it to people so I don't have to keep me saying it what questions do people ask I'm just curious like what would be the most asked question about you that is not specific to like how do I get you know fix get detached head or something but like not a technical question but just a question about you in general yeah um I should pull up my repo but uh let's see people often ask like startups versus big companies people often ask like should I get a computer science degree um they often ask what mechanical keyboard should I buy yeah uh what's it like being a woman in Tech uh should I write a cover letter for my job okay so practical uh you know yeah so so some some of them are practical some are very specific to my experience okay cool well we are going to talk about several of those things that just mention I can just link to this episode yeah mechanical keyboards something that you're interested in uh something that I I happen to have a mechanical keyboard I just use it when I'm on a PC and when um but I I have these little remote Mac ones like this because they're Compact and yeah chick you're like ah Sak blue no like like what is your interest in and how did they come about in mechanical keyboards it really just spiraled where I it started with me just wanting a pretty keyboard where I was just like my desk should be cuter and I always have just like a really boring looking keyboard and then I realized you could customize keyboards and then I just kind of took a nose dive deep into the entire keyboard Community where um there was a point I I lived in New York for several years and then moved to Seattle and I remember one of my co-workers that I was speaking to in New York right before moving he had the coolest keyboard and I just started asking questions like okay you 3D printed that and what switches are these what does this mean and so I just asked him a bunch of questions and then moving to Seattle Seattle is a hobbyist city I've said it before and I will always say this people are so into their hobbies in Seattle where and anything that you could be interested in you will find people interested in that where it's I admit it's kind of hard to make friends outside of of just the hobby but the hobby itself huge and so when I got to Seattle I just went in deep where I ended up being like on the board for nonprofit that taught kids Electronics via soldering mechanical keyboards and reran the Seattle mechanical keyboard Meetup that had like 3 to 400 people bringing their keyboards and that's a lot of people for a keyboard meet up my goodness like it was amazing and and like we had talks on like manufacturing and on stenography and and and so many cool things and and yeah I just kind of got really really deep and then I started designing keycaps because keyboards are expensive and I was just like if I design keycaps maybe I could get some free key caps so I'm not spending too much money that did not help me but hey some some of the key casts behind me I designed those ones I designed those ones I like it it just kind of became a fun thing where I just got really involved with this community that likes making things pretty and functional it's it's reminds me of just like Legos but with more electronics and it's very fun yeah I suppose as a developer you're kind of a crafts person and your tools of the trade your keybo right like that's that's how you kind of interface with the machine is uh and typing keyboards are never going to go out of style because you can type so efficiently and I love typing like whenever I need to think I open up a text editor I just start typing and and that's kind of like I use the pages kind of like an external brain for organizing my ideas I love typing uh what is it about typing and like keyboards that just you think get so many people to care about the kind of tool that they're using because you said it you had 400 people in Seattle by the way I'm interested like this is the first time I've ever heard the notion of Seattle is a developer or like I'm sorry like a hobbyist city do you think that has something to do with like all the rain and people staying indoors more yes I 100% that that's exactly what it is I think people are just like well we can't go outside because it's so rainy I guess we're going to get really into this one specific thing I and and there might be some seattleites who disagree but I'm going based on a lot of experience and what I saw um and yeah anyway typing is just it's something that you do it's something fun and also I'm going to shill my startup a little bit to talk about thinking out things but anyway uh yeah when I type on a mechanical keyboard and depending on the different switches all of my keyboards have different switches and different feels and stuff it's it's just kind of fun because it feels different depending on the keyboard that you use and some keyboards make you feel more productive some some are more loud some are more quiet I'm using a quiet one now because whenever I do recordings I have a silenced keyboard because I don't want to be clack clack clack that kind of stuff and so it's it's just kind of fun to have different options and different feels as as you type and and some keyboards I genuinely just type faster on and so I can type at the speed of thought kind of like what you're were saying yeah I when it comes to just like whistling while you work kind of like you're you're going to spend so much time typing like I don't know how do you have any idea like how many key strokes you make on your average day have you ever tried tracking that or anything like that I haven't I should but there's a lot yeah I I imagine you're just constantly typing and like that little tactile feedback it's just like people get really into their cars and like like having the the feel of the car against like exactly how much it slides how it feels when you're accelerating or when you're Switching gears and stuff like I can imagine like developers get the same thing cuz you're kind of doing a lot of those cheaper than a car yeah yeah well how much would like a like a middling mechanical keyboard like a starter mechanical keyboard start you can start relatively cheap I I actually just helped a friend buy one who has never gotten a keyboard before and and I think it was like $40 and and it was it's a nice keyboard like that's going to last for a long time um it they get pricey I I've I've typed on keyboards like at these meetups where it's like oh this is a $3,000 keyboard you type it you're just like oh that's why this is nice but I don't $3,000 keyboard I don't I don't need to go that far but I get it yeah so if money is No Object and you want to have like the best feel then yeah people people spend a lot of money on their Hobbies right I I think that's a reasonable use of of funds uh so let's talk a little bit about uh your startup because you mentioned that you're you know you're CTO and you it's you have uh wall jump many times from company to company over the years and you're like really high up now you're basically it's the Pinnacle as a developer unless you want to go find your own company uh the the pinnac and a lot of Founders are CTO as well maybe you could talk a little bit about that and ideation and and just getting your thoughts down on paper yeah cont contenda is that what it's called contenda yeah but uh we we're in a pivoting stage so we're building an app called brain story and we're uh speaking getting ideas down on paper that's what brain story does so sh'll Break um what we do at uh on brain story is you just talk to your browser about an idea you have and it could be you could be brainstorming like a whole new side project a blog post a conference talk you could just be wanting to talk out while you want to prep for a podcast or a meeting and as you talk it helps guide you uh as you as you speak where I could I could say to brain I'll be just like okay I know I want to build this feature in a side project but I don't know what the UI should look like it just asks me questions like okay well what's the most important thing about this UI and it so it it uses AI but it's not generative AI it just talks back to you and forces you to talk and then as you talk out your ideas Eureka you get answers and so I use it to write and speak and do a lot of things so what you're telling me is I'm spending all this time prompting AI but AI could be prompting me exactly yes and and and yeah and and I think that's the main differentiator and that's why we're we're trying to gear it more towards like students and non-technical people because a lot of developers will be just like well I could just build this with GPT I'm just like kind of but it's once again you're not prompting the computer the computer's prompting you to speak it's it's we call it iterative AI instead of generative AI yeah um but anyway startup things I uh I've been with contenda for a long time for for about three years but I actually started as an adviser for them um and we can get into advisory things in a bit but um my CEO she was a part of my patreon group which I have a patreon where I can help people like with resume reviews and have a Discord group and stuff so just to give people some context like maybe they would subscribe and like pay you you know $1 a month and then if they're at the higher tier maybe they get like a a oneon-one call with you every month or something like that and yeah and so like cheapest one is literally the lowest tier that patreon will give me and it's $2 a month and that just gives you access to the Discord and having that little pay wall is really good for keeping spammers out and so that that's that's that one but then yeah if you do $15 a month I'll review your resume and so we'll all the community to like give you tips and then there's like an interview prep one where like I'll get on one-on-one calls with you for as long as you do it to help interview prep with you um so anyway that's that's what that is and so anyway my CE she was a part of this patreon and she was just playing video games and kind of chilling in the group and she noticed that I was mailing stickers to everybody in the group by hand which took a lot of time and um she said hey if I build something that helps you mail stickers to people would you use it and I said yes cuz I'm getting a hand cramp from writing envelopes um and so she built a tool that we now call contenna which which mailed stickers to people and it did so well it actually helped lewig on Twitch break the world record for the most number of subscribers um which was cool but stickers don't really like Venture scale and so it she I I was an adviser at that point trying to like give tips as she was kind of working on this and then uh she had founding Engineers to help out and they ended up building tools for like helping you retain subscribers as a Creator and then eventually before the gpts came out it was transforming content where you could say like turn this podcast into a Blog post or turn these videos into tweets or something um and then the gpts came out and all of a sudden everybody knew about Ai and so there's so many pivots in there to try to be just like here's how we're different here's how you could do this but um because Chad gbt and all these tools came out the differentiating factors were getting Slimmer and Slimmer and so we were pivoting more and more again um and we had a developer API and in this time I joined as CTO um and so I I've been I've been full time as CTO for over a year now year and a halfish time isn't real but anyway not after the pandemic yeah seriously though it's it's wild um but anyway we had a developer API with our previous product and we thought oh let's build just like mini apps on top of our Dev API and see what could work and we had built this tool that we designed to help high school students write college essays um where it wouldn't write the essay for them but they could could just talk out like essay questions um and figure out like how they might want to frame their essay and it worked so well we were like wait a minute this could apply to others too and so we we thus brain story was born and it's just helps you talk out your ideas for anything and people have used it to plan D and D campaigns some people use it to like write literal like standup comedy sets um there's a big like contingent of like sports psychology like improving your mindset around certain by just talking it out performance Coes yeah yeah ex which is really just therapy but it's like therapy for professionals yeah exactly uh honestly there there was one user that where we were doing like a user test and she said I think this knows me better than my therapist we're like no this isn't a therapist we don't want that legal burden but uh that's what brain story is and and it's been really fun to work on very cool it is cool like you know just to give context if anyone hasn't heard the term pivot like a lot of times startups early on they everybody's trying to get traction right they trying to get a whole lot of people to you know essentially like use their product or you know better yet give them money so that they can go and they can get more funding and they can expand and you know do all these things that that startups do and uh so a pivot is just generally where you completely change your product or maybe it could be a smaller pivot like instead of doing like something in the same space you you your solution is slightly different you take a different approach AI caus a lot of companies to Pivot over the past few years uh and uh you know it also costs companies like Che that like you know would help people with their uh their homework and stuff uh you don't need to pay for you know answers to test questions and stuff like that so you can cheat on your test if you got like something like uh a foundational llm that can like help you just answer all the questions real quick and like teach you that stuff right so um yeah it's been quite tumultuous uh but I'm glad to hear that you all have been able to actually not only pay it but also incorporate some similar approaches even if you're not using like an llm per se uh I'm not sure do you do you all use llms at all yeah we we do some under the hood we we've done so many things custom where we're like now we're just like dang GPT makes this easy and so there we we uh do have some gupt stuff under the hood but a lot of it we've we've built in housee yeah and just to be like I have a policy like on the podcast I always explain acronyms even though I've said it probably a many times llm large language model uh gp4 being uh probably the most popular large language model so um and spoiler alert we we do have an interview with uh the first developer Advocate uh at open aai uh and she and I are neighbors we were just talking recently we're like so we live less than 10 minutes apart Chicago Connection wow Patrick being the person we're talking about yeah um you've lived in so many cities I know this is like a really bad transition you've lived in so many cities like so you grew up in Chicago then you moved uh to Ohio to go to Ohio say Iowa I always get those four letter O names mixed up Iowa State uh and then while you were there you of course got your CS degree and you've lived in like where what are other major cities of a bunch of cities yeah so so I've lived I yeah moved to Iowa for school and then for my internships I lived in Minneapolis Seattle and then the San Francisco Bay Area um I also lived in Spain for a good chunk of time for studying abroad and loved it that was amazing everybody should study abroad if they have the opportunity it's it's so great and I've gone back to Spain so many times since like it it I've maintained friendships there H it was the best um and then I lived in New York City after graduation for three years three or four years you lived in like every major city except for Dallas pretty much and then and then I lived in I lived in Seattle after that and then in the pandemic moved back to Chicago yeah wow so you you've like hit basically every major city and one of the things that is that really intrigues me about your career this past decade plus that you've been working in Tech is that you've changed jobs a lot and there's conventional wisdom that like oh you get a job and you keep it for at least two years you don't have gaps you don't have uh you know you don't want to have to explain your your job changes to uh some HR person because it's an awkward conversation but um you know did they quietly push you out and then you just resigned and made it look like you Chang jobs or like there's always that suspicion like looming over like why this person keeps changing jobs are they just not a good fit or are they overly careerist and they're just trying to ascend the ladder as quickly as possible like why have you changed job so much and like and what do you think are the stigmas around that and do you think they're warranted yeah yeah I think there are stigmas around it and and for some of them yes like I will say if you see a bunch of people work I I've talked to people I'm just like all of your jobs have been like two months or less that's very short I I try to I try to stay a little bit longer at places and I never go into a job thinking like I'm going to be out of here in a year I I always try to to stay as long as possible but just life happens and I think just as an aside it's really good to do like life audits to be like are you going in the direction where you want to be going um and is your job stopping you from doing that um and so after college I went to venmo and I was a Dev Advocate there it was really fun I I was working on the product itself um I built blocking so if you ever block someone but no that was me um cool and then uh also how does that work you block people they can't send you money anymore or do people send you money like is there a messaging client or something well people would like be annoying people or harassing people by just sending one cent at a time with like annoying payment messages ah people people be annoying but anyway um so loved being at venmo it was a really really cool place to work they were bought out and um them right yeahp right yeah PayPal bought them and and this was before eBay and PayPal split and stuff and and they were actually bought by a company named Brain tree and PayPal bought them we jokingly called it ventry palb because it was venmo brain tree PayPal eBay and then like PayPal and eBay split while I was there chaotic time so a lot of chaos that was completely out of your control and and you just want to like work on product and yeah there's probably all kinds of org changes and like they ended up discontinuing the API and as a Dev Advocate what are you supposed to do if the API is going away like that kind of stuff and so I ended up leaving because like I was talking to fellow co-workers on like the brain tree and PayPal side and they're just like they're not going to be supporting you much longer if you have an opportunity you should probably get out of Dodge and so that's why I ended up leaving um yeah and and I'm so grateful to them they were they were really kind people who I still keep in touch with who were like looking out for me in that regard and um so anyway yeah I left that's not the only time your company that you've been working at has been acquired right like is that happened another time that's yeah so that that's happened that happened again so after venmo I went to a company called clarify they're an AI startup um I think they're series C now they do cool like image recognition things I I loved working there too I actually worked with my sister there for a little bit of time before she went off to Google and um I moved and remote work wasn't as much of a thing then and so I was moving from New York to Seattle and that is what caused me to do that job change where just personal life things and so after that I went to a company called L4 L4 digital which was a creative Agency on Seattle Super loved that too it was also bought out and so that that one was bought out by a a large company based in Argentina called glent and um it was it was cool kind of being involved with them but uh they were very quickly changing a lot of the company culture and everything and and uh it it just it just wasn't the kind of environment that I was really wanting to stick a part of but I but I really enjoyed that job cuz I was an engineering manager there as well as just engineering on a bunch of cool client projects um but yeah eventually I was just like the I think I was there a little more than a year and a half but the large company changes were uh kind of messing with the the culture enough that I decided to go and then I went to Amazon which was a bad choice um for me I'm sure there are people who love their jobs at Amazon and are there for a long time but I knew like two weeks in that they pay very well but at what cost and it was like truly a golden handcuff situation and so I tried to stick it out but there came a point where I was just like the money is not worth it I'm really unhappy here um and so I quit after about seven months at Amazon and then went to Coden which was awesome yeah codepen amazing tool C is such a great tool yeah and I I still talk to those people to this day like literally yesterday um they're they're such a great team and I really loved working on codepen um building out features and stuff and it was just a straight up software engineering role not Dev advocacy or anything but as a result I was kind of missing the dev advocacy stuff um and so I would like still occasionally speak at conferences and and uh do more developer facing things and that was where I started doing the Tik Tock and and just started kind of doing more public things while also working on the product um but they needed they needed someone who's just software engineering who who wasn't doing the dev advocacy stuff and and uh are doing like the public speaking things and we we kind of tried to see if there was a balance there and and honestly there just wasn't there were just like we're so sorry but we can't really support like you going to conferences and stuff we need you to be engineering and um so we parted ways I I I was just like I love you guys but I'm going to go do something for developers because I really like the teaching aspect um and uh yeah the that one was a shame because I I really loved working at codepen I just wanted to be working with developers more and um so then I went and became a full-time teacher and so I I was teaching at a company called react training full-time and it was great I was I was traveling a ton and just giving workshops on how to write react better all the time um that is where I started live streaming a bit more on on the react side too it was great um and then the pandemic happened and uh at that I guess that puts a Kash on like a lot of the activity that you would have as a teacher if you're doing like inperson workshops and stuff it did yeah I was I was doing so much iners stuff that like I called 2020 in January I was like this is going to be my year of travel I'm going to do like a last Terra and then I'll stop and so like I went to Austria I went to Boston I went to SF I went to France I went to Ireland I I went to Hawaii I was traveling a ton just in January and February and then in early March I was coming back from Dublin I was going to be home for three days then go to Spain and then shut down and everything started shutting down and digital workshops weren't just simply weren't as much of a thing at that point people probably were less inclined to pay a lot of money companies were probably less inclined to send their employees to something that is just a virtual webinar type thing and so like within two weeks react training had to shut down cuz we just W two weeks well at least I mean kudos to them for rep recognizing the writing on the wall that this was going to be a big thing the biggest thing that's happened in our lifetime probably hopefully the biggest thing that will happen in our lifetime yeah it was it was wild and and it was such a shame too cuz we said at the beginning of March we're like we have so many workshops in March we just have to get through March and then we'll have runway for like two or three years and we couldn't get through March so um anyway that that that is what led me to leave react training because the company shut down and uh then I went to NFI after that and nlii was great I I was doing Dev advocacy on act in xjs there and had a blast and and I did that for for a while um and then after like almost two years I was just starting to burn out a ton because I moved up into management as like a director of Dev experience there and uh it was just it was so much work um but it was like a combination of doing the director work and the individual contributor work um where I was still like coding writing blog posts doing all these things but I was also in meetings like so so many meetings like 11 to 15 meetings a day it was like like 10 minute meetings or like how are you doing no they were not I I like it was it was too much and and the it was the kind of thing where I really loved the product and working on it I just physically couldn't handle it anymore um and so I ended up I ended up leaving because I I was just burning out but I'm to this day I'm still an adviser for them where like I still talk with them regularly and stuff and have a great relationship with them because I do like the product and what they're doing I just was so tired yeah they're they're a cool company and you know I as I always like to tell the tale of me being in hackathons with Matt bman the founder uh and they've been a supporter of Freo Camp early on uh as well and we we have used their tools over the years um so many things to talk about so many things and I I still have two more jobs to go okay go ahead let's continue yeah and so after that I I considered starting my own thing and like took a little break cuz I was like maybe I will maybe I will then I didn't and I ended up going to remote remote.com to uh I was ahead of developer education there and I was going to see like okay what what resources can I provide for remote developers remote grew so fast where when I first started talking with them in like early pandemic days just like friendly they were at like 25 people then when I interviewed it was more like 200 people wow which was quite a big jump but I joined they were at a thousand people they exploded in growth you can't gr that quickly without making a lot of bad hires in my opinion like I just don't I don't believe for a second that an organization can grow that quickly without cracks forming I it was yeah and unfortunately I think I kind of was falling through some of those cracks where like everybody was so kind and and there's such lovely people there which once again still stay in touch with them um but it just grew so fast and and I would be working on something like I I ran like the devs for Ukraine conference to uh help support developers there and people there to raise money and I I was able to do some cool initiatives but so many things I was just like hey this is like the plan for this and people would say Cassidy that's awesome we don't have time for that because it was growing so much um and so anyway I really liked it there but it just it was so much um and then this is where like the personal things came into play I got pregnant and I was just like is this the kind of role that I want to continue doing while I'm pregnant and will I have the flexibility to like be able to take care of my kid and stuff and um that's when I started talking more with contendo where I've been I had been an adviser for them for a year a year and a half for them at that point and um they had been talking to me about how they wanted to find a CTO to fill in some gaps and so as I was talking with them I was like so what if I was that CTO and and uh we kind of talked as a whole team and it just kind of was a very natural fit where I knew everybody really well I had met with them in person a bunch of times and and we we were like friends in addition to colleagues and stuff and yeah it just seemed like the right fit and I've been with them ever since awesome so many different stops your journey uh and uh I'm going to link to your LinkedIn in case anybody wants to to follow you there or like read through I was in I was like you know she's she's younger than I am uh I don't know I'm not going to ask your age but you're like way younger than me and yet youve worked at like 10 times as many places as I am I think it's it's wild like I think there were like 20 plus entries on your like experience so many of it is like advisory roles and like parttime things too but yeah I and it like when I go into the story like that companies never question why I have such a big resume they're just like oh well of of course oh yeah that makes sense like it's it's never me just saying I wanted more money so I left it's it's usually you have good reasons for every single thing and one of the two of the reasons that I do want to drill deeper into one is you know the notion of culture which a lot of people uh who are privileged just like culture doesn't even exist what is that it's like nonsense you know Corp culture always exists yeah what are what you would call cultural indicators uh and and maybe we can back up and we can talk about if you don't mind me just saying your experience in Tech as a woman because women uh I don't like it but women are a minority in Tech I think they depending on like maybe maybe you have like a good estimate of the number of women in Tech or the proportion of women in last stat I saw was 133% 133% yeah and there was like a stack Overflow survey a few years ago where like 6% of the respondents were women or something like that that it was like really low um and of course like I can tell you like fre Co Camp we're very proud that about a third of the people learning on free Camp are women that's not 50% but right but still that's good proportionally compared to a lot of the industry and it's going to be a multigenerational effort to get more women into Tech uh in my humble opinion uh there are lots of cultural things and a lot of economic reasons and a lot of just like systemic you know bias reasons uh but maybe you could talk a little bit about your own kind of like entree into Tech and the first time that you felt like wow I I didn't realize there were so few women in Tech yeah I found out early on that there were not many women in Tech because I took AP Computer Science in high school where I first started coding before that where I was just like oh wait you can make websites and I was really excited to play around with with HTML CSS JavaScript and just kind of was figuring things out and was having a blast doing it and then when I realized that my school was offering AP Computer Science I was like oh I'm going to take that and and it'll be great and literally the first thing that the teacher said in the class on the first day was as you can see we have a girl this year I was like oh and uh yeah that that that was a very rude awakening where it just the that was the theme for a lot of girl this year that's wild yeah that that was my first like group inter action um but that is how I found NC wit which I mentioned earlier where where like and what what is National Center for Women in it I'm going to link to that yeah they're awesome they they have uh awards for high school girls every year and then they also have a Collegiate organization they they're they're a research organization so they put together really good uh research um and informationals that companies can use and stuff they're they're a really great orc but any anyway I first got involved with them because in that class when I would like finish an exercise and had time I would just start like looking up like how do how do I find other girls because I just didn't know where they were um and yeah so that that's how I first got involved with NY wit um because I was looking for a community where I didn't have one yet so you were not content to just accept that like okay everybody I interact with is going to be a dude you very early tried to like build connections with other women at Tech yeah and like I'm okay with I'm okay with hanging out dudes and I kind of have to be because because of the nature of tech and and so many of my college courses there would be like one or two of us or or something just funny story recently I was I was just walking around in Chicago and I saw one of the girls where she was like the other one in my course and we looked at each other like you live in Chicago hi and like we just hadn't seen each each other since college and it was cool to be just where like we were introducing our husbands and we were just like she was the other one we this is great um the bond it's it's forever but uh anyway it it was something where like I knew there had to be something out there and then luckily there was and it's something where in general I think you should have a community no matter the industry to stay in it where people have your back um where like whe whether whether it's a diverse one or not it should be a diverse one but you know like it it's having a community that can check on you and be just like hey how did this thing go I know you were worried about it or hey good luck on your job interview this day or or let's talk through this problem you're having or something Have having that kind of community is so so valuable and I think is particularly pretty hard again in this post-pandemic world but again that's why I have like my patreon Discord group we have we are such a great Community where it's just us talking about this is this is what I'm trying to learn right now and uh there's there's so many good ones associated with free code camp and on Twitter and and various places have having those communities is so important and that's that's been something that has been so helpful to me throughout my career yeah and so you've talked a little bit in the past about like kind of cultural indicators that you look for to companies you even tweeted a few days ago I think I was scrolling through your Twitter earlier that you think that companies should offer three different things and if they don't offer at least two of those three things you shouldn't consider them as like a serious opportunity uh maybe do you recall what those three things were yeah and so that that's while you're at the company or while you're interviewing they should have good pay good culture and good growth opportunities yeah two out of three is pretty good all three would be great um but if if you're at a company and you realize oh I only have one out of three or something or or I don't have any of these or or something you might want to question why you're there that doesn't necessarily mean jump ship because having a job is good but yeah if you if you don't question those kinds of things then you will be stuck in a situation that's not serving you well yeah well I would argue that like just from looking at the job application you can probably figure out the compensation if they publicly list that and you you might even be able to surmise like software engineer 2 probably leads to software engineer 3 probably leads to like Engineering Management you know role uh so like assuming it's like a big tech company and that people do gradually rise up the ranks um that is that's basically two of them that you can kind of surmise just from doing a little bit of research but culture is a little bit trickier and how would you establish whether a company has a you know a healthy culture that's like conducive to being able to work and be sane and stuff like that how would you figure that out if you were on the outside and you were looking at a company and considering applying what what are the uh kind of the telltale signs of like potentially toxic culture yeah well so first of all one that I've seen and where I've actually like gone in the other direction is where they say oh we don't really have a culture yet all companies have a culture like if you say that there is no culture that means that there might not be a great culture like like all companies have have some element of culture there um but then I also I'm very curious to sus out how people communicate across an orc um and so I typically one question that I actually ask in job interviews is what's the most important thing the customer the product or the employees and none of those answers are wrong like those are all actually like they're they're all three important but if you were to pick one what what is the most important customer product or employees um and what's interesting about the answers is how people answer them and if that answer is consistent across interviewers where like when I interviewed at Amazon every single person said the customer like it was a very very clear customer Obsession right I customer Obsession that's what they're all about yeah and and so you know that they communicate well on that front and granted the culture wasn't that great when I was at Amazon but it it it was a good indicator of how people communicated and when people answer that question differently then it's interesting to see okay why do you why do they answer it differently how did their answers differ um when they explain it because sometimes the the way they explain it you're just like oh it makes sense why this person would answer this way and this person would answer this way but um again none of those answers are wrong but it's useful to see we're like when I internet into it I I've been doing this for a lot many years now internet into it everybody said oh the employees are number one and and here's why I think it and and it's it's cool to see how people communicate about what their environment is and then one last one that uh that I like to ask is just if you had a magic wand and could change anything about the company what would you change um and seeing people do that where like like it's not necessarily a bad thing but what what is the magic wand that that thing that you would change people's answers there are very good ways to sus out how things are where sometimes people are just like I would get rid of this group in the company where where it's just like I I don't want we have too many product managers or something um sometimes the answer has been I don't like that we're under the fist of capitalism I would probably wish away our VCS or something like that and and you can kind of see what is the thing that drives uh culture or NE anything negative or or something at the company and so anyway those are the questions I answer and it's been pretty helpful for those are great questions um especially like what would you wish away man like when you as that I was like what would I well we're not interviewing me here but one thing I would wish away is the complexity of the US immigration system I would I would love to be able to say to everybody who works at freeo Camp we're going to get you and H1B visa and if you want you can come and live here in the US um so that unfortunately that's yeah I mean you you probably I don't know how much of the immigration system you've had to go through with your husband but it was it's been it's been yeah yeah it's quite complicated to uh to get even like so we have a team member here in the US and sorry I'm not going to like bash the us but I will bash the US immigration system that is one thing that I've I think that's fair it's within my right as a US taxpayer as somebody who works to you know make this country better that I can complain about the immigration system so uh we have a team member who is working she's also working at Salesforce uh she's working parttime at free Co Camp developing some courses and she you know studied in the US she's worked as a software engineer at Salesforce for like four years um actually it may not be four years but she's the four years that she's been here in the US she's applied to the H1B Lottery and she every single time she has not gotten it and this is absolutely the kind of like well-educated like highly compensated like expert that the US yeah and she's going to have to move to Canada if she doesn't win this time like there's like a limit in the number of times and Salesforce actually has like an entire like plan in place for uh employees who can't get an H1B Visa through the lottery uh despite spending you know tens of thousands of dollars and everything to try to get help them get that they have to move up to Vancouver from the San Francisco Bay area and they have to continue working from the Vancouver you know satellite so it's just one of those things it's like why does America shoot itself in the foot with this terrible immigration system but anyway I'm sorry I'll stop venting but but that is my magic that would be a great magic wand I would like to borrow that one that's one of the few things that like me as like a founder and like executive director which is basically the charity equivalent of a of a CEO like that's one thing that I feel completely powerless over uh I can change so much and like like we we work very hard to attract lots of women to work at free C Camp and and as I may have said earlier we're like nearly half women on our team both engineering and instructional and you know we're proud of that and yeah it takes a concertive effort to not only uh encourage women to join your team but to retain them over time because yeah uh it sounds like some of your cultural experiences I mean like when you look at culture like how much of it has come down to like they they do they have systematic bias against women at some of these organizations you worked at I don't want you to have to like Lobby specific lob specific accusations or anything but I left Amazon for a reason like and and luckily like with with some of the organizations sorry there's a big siren coming out outside so no worries we're in Chicago after all and it's a big city like a do you live in the BBS or I live in Chicago proper yeah oh wow yeah it's and it's great I just happen to live somewhat near a fire St so that's why we have some Sirens but anyway um luckily I think in a lot of my jobs it hasn't been too bad relatively speaking like like I I have no room to complain because people close to me have gone through so much worse that being said it exists there there's there's definitely systemic biases and very unkind people in the world who who let those biases the affect their decisions and and the words they say and the things that they do um and yeah when when I I'll just a a brief vignette when I was at Amazon like there was a point where I was for example supposed to run an event for a bunch of uh customers who were building on top of the echo devices I'm not saying her name because she's back there and she'll talk back okay um but anyway I was I was running inent it was a big deal like I was literally reporting certain findings to the s team which is the people who reports Jeff Bezos like it it was a big event and people weren't responding to my emails and I was like you need to submit your talks to me so I can put together this and and like make sure that these technical areas are covered and stuff people just wouldn't respond to me and I remember talking to my manager saying like hey do I need to build some clout here or something to so that way people respond he said oh it's cuz you're a woman we have a problem with that here like cool great well at least he acknowledge that it's a known issue but yeah do something about it what the heck so and like he he replied all to my group email to all of these people saying Hey give Cassidy the info they would say okay hey Dave here's the stuff like within an hour after me him they wouldn't add addressing him not me and like there were that that's like a very brief small minor thing but there was so much more that happened beyond that that like it it just it was miserable and and unfortunately like that was nothing compared to what some of the women on my team were going through there or my own sister was going through there yeah let's talk about your sister a little bit too she's somebody we I mean you've mentioned her a couple times but she followed very closely in your footsteps it sounds like or as you said before we met she followed in her own footsteps tell us a little bit about your sister footsteps yeah yeah and so my sister and I were were pretty close in age and we both majored in computer science that Iowa State um and uh we've worked together multiple times and then all and really diverged because we both like very different environments where um she and I both worked at clarify the startup and then we also both worked at Amazon together and uh I love startups she loves big companies so she she's kind of collected like The Infinity Gauntlet of big companies where she's worked at Apple Microsoft Google Amazon and now meta got to catch them all wow that's that's impressive like the entire Fang basically she's literally all the like she doesn't have Netflix but once she does she's done she she's made it but but yeah so she she must get a lot of recruiters reaching out to her my goodness I can only imagine and I hope I would like to think that her recruit like in recruiting like one of the big things the signal is where they already work because if they're good enough to work there there's a good chance they're good enough to work here like I can imagine she has a very easy time getting jobs if she does have a hard time getting jobs she's also just really good at what she does yeah and so and and it's fun cuz she and I work together really well like it's it's really fun to do things with her like when we were both at clarify we would sometimes give talks together um which was a blast because that people would approach us being like how long did you rehearse that your back and forth was amazing and we were just like we didn't we're related we've been practicing this for decades um and uh yeah and when we both worked at Amazon we did like a live stream for the echo showing people how to how to work with like buttons and stuff together and that was so fun too so we we really enjoy working together but we like very different work environments yeah where uh like my my mom says like I'm like the wild west cowboy and she's the one who's like an English writer where she prefers like a lot of structure big organization all that and I kind of just don't want anybody to bother me as I do what I want to to start that's so interesting that you all have very similar like I would imagine probably pretty similar upbringing both growing up in Chicago both studying at the same school both studying in the same field working at some of the same companies and yet it sounds like personality wise and certainly in terms of preferences for career You're So Different yeah yeah exactly and like there's a lot of similarities don't get me wrong like we both married software engineers and and uh do have a lot of similar hobbies and stuff but yeah she she and I are very different in what we like in terms of what makes us productive and everything and and we both are very interested in Dev advocacy and teaching and helping developers but she approaches from a I have a big company with all of these resources if I can like play the system well enough I can offer this many resources to people and with me I like the scrappy approach where it's just like what can I do to provide these resources to people and and the we we both have varying levels of success with different approaches stuff but it it works well for both of us yeah it sounds like it um I mean you both obviously have these story careers and it's so interesting to see like how you've diverg one thing that I would like to talk about because you talked about productivity and you also alluded earlier to burnout is you are somebody who is like you have a literal baby like I think he said is like nine months old yeah and you also are a CTO and you're also creating all this content pretty reliably uh on like all these different platforms like how do you avoid burnout when you're doing all those things and have you ever gotten close to burnout and since you were getting close and like been able to pull back before you go over the burnout Cliff so to speak and have to like climb your way all the way up the mountain again yeah I've really had to learn how to say no um I think my my two biggest burnout times where um one point at venmo I I was saying yes to everything because I was like if I do a lot of work now while I like am young and have energy it'll be good for me later in very yes but it was terrible for me healthwise where like there was a period where I spoke at an event for 14 days straight like including the weekends in addition to the 9 to-5 job I I just I was doing way too much and I just burnt out so hard after that I like ran off to Florida to hang out with my grandpa after that that's wild 14 man how did you like get from event to event was it just like was it all in like the Bay Area or some kind of Cal it was mostly in New York City and then yeah there was there's I think there's a little bit of travel like by train at point I don't even remember all of them because it was a bad choice um anyway so that that was a big one and then um I'm not counting College I kind of burnt out at one point in college it was fine I almost went blind but then I went moved to Spain and I was fine um and then uh the next one was at NFI I was really close to burning out and again that's why I ended up leaving where I still loved that team and everything but I was just I I had to for my health I had to I had to go um and and I think yeah now I see the signs more where I'm just like oo I need to cut back on this or that and and I think a lot of burnout it doesn't come from doing a lot because kind of like you said I I tend to do a lot but it's more doing a lot that isn't aligned with your values yeah and that isn't aligned with what's important to you we like my Weekly Newsletter it's a lot of work because it's weekly and there's there's a lot to do with it and stuff and I manage sponsors and and all of the interview practice question responses and and various content things like that but it's something that's important to me it's something that I ultimately like doing and my like goal of helping developers it works towards that goal and so it it doesn't cause me to burn out um and if I were to do something that is not aligned with what matters to me where it's it's truly just like I know I can do this but it's it's a ton of work I think that's that's what would cause me to burn out more interesting so doing things that are not aligned with your values that don't feel like they're advancing what you care about advancing that seems to be uh a theme but like are there any signs you said that you kind of saw the signs yeah uh of burnout and like what are the signs people should be looking for not caring anymore I feel like I feel like that's probably the biggest the biggest sign red flag thing that you could see where where if you start to be like resigned to this is this is just how it is I just don't care anymore I'm just kind of going through the emotions that's the biggest one for me cuz though I don't think like work should be everything to you I don't think that it should be like the thing that you only care about it it's something that you it's something that you do for so much of your life you should care about it a little bit and uh if you simply just don't care anymore it's it's kind of like the the opposite of Love isn't hate it's indifference it's it's that kind of stuff where where if you if you truly are just I I can tell when I'm starting to get to a burnout point where like if I'm in a meeting or something I'm just like none of this matters I don't know why like like you you kind of just like start to feel that and and I feel like that's for me that's the biggest number one sign more than any like tiredness or or stress things yeah I'm just trying to think of like if you find yourself in that situation where you feel you're just getting more distant from the task at hand you're carrying less about the outcome of different things uh good news resonates less positively with you it doesn't really lay bad news you feel numb what um what can you do to like shake that up like obviously burnout you you finished College despite getting almost going blind you said yeah is there is that a long story or is just like long story short I took way too many courses because I knew I was going to be moving to Spain and I wasn't sleeping I was sleeping on average like between 1 and 3 hours a night at the most and yeah almost went blind don't do that kids like you went to the doctor and they said if you keep doing this you're going to lose your vision like what like how do it wasn't so much if you keep doing this it was one day I couldn't open my eyes and they were like I I remember I went to vacation with my family and I had to wear an eye patch the whole time because like I literally couldn't open one of my eyes anymore and like we were at like a literally like a doctor in a poblo and he was just like something's wrong with your eye like the whites of my eyes were gray and and like they were just my eyes were disintegrating anyway you should sleep that's the that's the conclusion there okay yeah sleep PSA Public Service Announcement please sleep everybody sleep eight hours if you can yeah but but to answer your question though about like what you can do um first of all lean on your community I've said that before I feel like the the first answer that a lot of people might shout is self-care but if you shout self-care at someone who could use a community um that that's that's doing a disservice to that person it's it's really important to have people around you who can kind of talk to you and and like kind of kind of give you a reality check and and and be there for you but then also on the self-care front do things that you like and and just say no to certain things and be just like I need to step back from this or something and build a Lego set go travel and run off to Florida to see your grandpa like do do do something that that is very unrelated to work sometimes for me it's truly just like I'm going to just watch a K drama on Netflix I I I'm gonna do K my mom loves those they're so good but but yeah like like do do something that is like just for you to remind yourself I am a person Beyond this thing that I am not like doing and and sometimes like when I start approaching that moment I just do one of those things and I'm okay like a week later um and if it's something that's more prolonged and heavy that it's much harder to to fight against that but it's now acknowledged in multiple countries now that burnout is a real mental condition that that you need to fight against and you need to try to be proactive in leaning on the people that you care about be around people who care about you and do things that you care about yeah yeah I mean I I like to say that like you can accomplish so much in your life life is so long it's almost ridiculous how long life is and I say this as like a 43y old man who like can't believe that like if everything goes well I've got like a whole another 40 50 years to look forward to uh because it feels like life has been forever especially during the pandemic when time slowed down you can accomplish so much if you just don't burn out and just put forth like a consistent effort over time that's one of the things that really inspires me about you is you have kept going in terms of your newsletter for example you have kept going in terms of streaming in terms of creating these videos like you you you're not the kind of person who seems to get bored of something and just completely starts from fresh and like jumps from one fan flight of fantasy to the next like you're you're incredibly consistent over time and that's how I know that like I'm going to be excited to watch a cuz good things are are coming to you I want to talk about advice for people out there who may not feel that good things are coming to them and may not know how to get in the Rhythm like people that just got a CS degree and are having trouble uh applying for jobs people that are transitioning into Tech having difficulty applying for jobs there's like this kind of miasma in the air like oh Tech is dead like Developer jobs don't go there go go back to like culinary school or what real estate whatever kind of crap advice people are getting in my humble op like I don't want to B like don't go to culinary school I heard from so many chefs that like nobody goes to culinary school but like but yeah like like how do you counter that and how do you reassure people that no this The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow you know it's just a rainy day yeah and that's that's the thing I feel like a lot of new devs or people who haven't been through a few spells of the oh no Tech is dying the they're they're just like oh my gosh Tech really is dying I'm kind of just like it's died before it's but it keeps coming back there like we are in an increasingly digital world and Tech is going nowhere like sure we're going there's like waves of layoffs and stuff happening economies come and go but it's going to come back and you might as well be prepared for when it does and and I already like knock on wood who knows what's going on but uh it feels like it's already coming back uh like jobs wise and stuff I was talking to a friend yesterday where she was saying I don't know if I should quit my job she saw my tweet about like the three things that you should have in a role and she's like I have barely one of these I but like I'm afraid to apply and I said I think things are coming back and she messaged me like two hours later saying oh my gosh there's so many jobs what nobody's talking about how many people are hiring right now everybody's just talking about the layoffs don't listen to the the loud people shouting that the sky is falling like keep an eye out for good opportunities because there are so many uh you just have to know where to look and you also don't have to work at a very traditional tech company you don't have to work for like the microsofts and the apples you could work for a company like General Mills which is where one of my internships were food compan company lots of tasty breakfast cereal oh my gosh I had so many snacks there it was an amazing place to work I loved General Mills um but anyway like if I move to Minneapolis Sunday it's because I want to work there um there there's there's so many companies out there that can offer you good pay work life balance that aren't tech companies um they a good culture good good learning opportunities and and you just have to be willing to look where where one friend of mine uh was so burnt out by the tech industry he was just like I I feel like I need to quit software engineering but I like software engineering but I'm just tired of this environment and and he decided to just look into health and be like well where how can I help like doctors and stuff without actually having to become one and now he works for a health tech company where it's very separate from the shouting on Twitter and and like the the what is the next thing after react type conversations and he loves it where he's able to do these skills that he has but he's working at a company that's not Tech related he's just using his Tech skills and and the stat that I've always heard is like two-thirds of Developer jobs are outside of what we traditionally consider Tech General Mills is not a tech company you know I would not argue that the car companies are tech companies or that Finance is Tech you know uh we we had a long conversation about this the other day uh I genuinely believe that uh if you're just looking at the big companies that are just doing these kind of layoffs like um a lot of which is like you know fast follower kind of like hey it's okay to lay people off CU you know this company just did so we're going to do it too right um and and a lot of employers will use like the the economy as an excuse for um just basically trying to have additional bargaining power over job candidates and things like that uh I love what you say don't listen to the loud people shouting that the sky is falling like don't listen to them the future is bright and one of the things that people shout a whole lot is AI is GNA take our gerbs right I mean what are your thoughts yeah it is but um like it's gonna improve but yeah I mean like that is probably the most common question I get uh every week I get dozens of emails I'm not exaggerating because I I send like 7 million emails my email list is really big and uh when people reply they're like hey is any of this even matter like aren't the AI just going to be able to do everything the developer can do and better like uh they have this kind of old John Henry kind of like driving spikes uh thing in their mind but that's not how software works and you know I I don't want to answer the question before I ask it but like what would you say to somebody who feels like they skills are going to be quickly outmoded by Ai and that in the future nobody's going to have a job and stuff like what would you say to them because I think my my pet theory is that it's very easy to procrastinate learning to code because it's such a big ambitious Endeavor and it's it's really good like copium if you will to to just say like well it doesn't matter if I learn to code anyway because the jobs aren't going to be there so therefore my decision to play video games yeah exactly like what do you think yeah Tech isn't good or Tech is going to keep going on and AI is probably not going to take your job AI is a really good tool and I feel like you can use it as such where like I'm sure when someone invented the crane there are a bunch of construction workers saying like oh no what are we going to do this big heavy thing is going to lift a big heavy thing and and I won't lift a big heavy thing now they're just using that tool to help lift the big heavy things kind of like when Alpha go came out uh I play Go daily I love playing go it's like that grid with the black and white pieces and back in like very accurate portrayal in that uh Knives Out movie yeah that was that was so fun I made a Kickstarter for go back in the day and used a clip from it but anyway um it's it's such a fun game this Alpha go bot like beat out so many different players but that doesn't mean that people stop playing go it's it's still such a fun and interesting game and now Alpha go is great at teaching you moves there are some moves that professionals were just like this is the correct move in this scenario for hundreds of years and then alphago changed that for the first time and people were just like wait we just never saw that you can use these tools to unlock different ways of thinking and different ways of being productive where I think like GitHub co-pilot is a really good example where it is a co-pilot it's a thing that can help you write things it's not always going to be right you are ultimately in the driver's seat building something but it can help you where like I don't need to write yet another sorting function or I don't need to write yet another hello world react component that I can just add stuff to I can I can do that and you can let it be a tool that you use to get your ideas across and be more productive on things it doesn't have to be this thing that's it's just going to take your job and I don't think it's going to take your job for a while cuz some of the codes where I've been just like oh AI wrote this for me amazing has been so bad or later I'm just like wait why did I listen to the AI llms large language models are very good at predicting what the next word should look like but that doesn't mean it's the right word and they are so bad at math and I use math as an example because math is a very precise thing if you have it do like a demo function for something a lot of the answers are going to be wrong because it's not actually executing code it's not actually doing the logic just does what it thinks the logic should look like and so anyway all that being said yes it's getting better and better but that just means that you can use it to solve more interesting problems 100% agreed use AI as a tool don't use it as an excuse not to learn ma math programming computer science you should still learn these skills and um I hope that you know people will follow you and watch many of your amazing videos maybe even join your patreon community because it sounds like Community is like a big deal in cat City Williams land and the fact that you've had that Community there you've you've helped Yourself by having that community and other people in your community are helping one another um Community self-care is no substitute for having other people who have your back and having that feeling that you're part of a tribe and you can help other people and they'll help you that General Vibe of reciprocation so I've learned so much from this conversation with you and I'm going to encourage everybody to check out the show notes below where I've included lots of links to interesting stuff about Cassidy uh and I I just want to thank you for your time because you know you're a busy mom CTO you're doing all these things and I feel very grateful that you've taken the time to come on the free code Camp podcast thank you so much for having me it was a really fun time well everybody until next week happy coding bye\", metadata={'source':
