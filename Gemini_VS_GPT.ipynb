      "[Document(page_content='(cube bounces) (electronic crackling) - Budget phones are fun, because, pretty much with all of them, if you poke around hard enough, you will find the thing that\\nthey had to cut corners on, you\\'ll find the thing\\nthat they trimmed back to get it to be a budget phone. And so for picking one for\\nyou, it\\'s just a matter of picking the one that\\nmakes the trade offs that you\\'re okay with. Like maybe you love, you gotta have good build\\nquality and cameras. Well then, iPhone SE is\\nprobably a good one for you. And then you know you\\'re\\nnot gonna get a great screen or battery life or things like that. Or maybe you gotta have\\na great big screen. Samsung makes the Galaxy A54. Ar maybe you gotta have\\ngood software and cameras. Pixel 7A. This phone is 350 bucks. And this, this is the designer one. (sophisticated electro-jazz music) (electronic crackling) So, this phone is not\\ngoing to win anyone over with raw specs. It\\'s not gonna win by\\nhaving the best camera or the best battery life\\nof any budget phone. The performance isn\\'t gonna\\nblow you outta the water, but you could definitely argue that it\\'s the prettiest $350 phone. So Nothing has had this\\ntransparent aesthetic going for a while with their phones, and then also the earbuds. This one definitely also has that. There\\'s also a white version of this. I think it looks better, it\\nalso has like black buttons, so it\\'s kinda this nice contrast, but, you know, dark\\nversion looks cool too. And honestly if the mission is\\nto look like a Nothing phone, and not be mistaken for anything else, then, yeah, mission\\ndefinitely accomplished. The dual cameras in the\\nmiddle and near the top is pretty unique. Kinda like a pair of eyes maybe. And the NFC coil actually\\nsurrounds the cameras. Then there are three bars of\\nLEDs making a glyph design around the camera circle again. Then it\\'s kinda this split design, the bottom half is like\\na PCB-inspired look, apparently inspired by the\\nNew York City subway map. And Nothing\\'s already shown people this, like there\\'s been some\\nreactions to the design already. Some people love it, some\\npeople actually hate it. I don\\'t know, it\\'s a bit asymmetrical, so it\\'s unconventional for\\nsure, but I think it\\'s nice, not gonna lie. But even if you don\\'t like\\nit, at least you can say it\\'s at least somewhat\\nvisually interesting. You know, there\\'s some textures,\\nthere\\'s some exposed screws and some text and that little red square, it\\'s not functional, it\\'s\\njust purely to look cool, so, I appreciate that. And if you do like this look but have maybe a more boring phone that you\\'re not willing to give up, then channel sponsor dbrand has you covered with\\ntheir Something skins. So if you haven\\'t heard of it already, dbrand has performed some, and these are their words, not mine, \"Creative plagiarism\" on\\nNothing\\'s whole design language, both in light mode and dark mode, so I\\'ll leave a link below\\nif you wanna check those out. But guess what? It\\'s an extremely\\ncompetitive price bracket, so you get a good looking phone, but you still will have to\\nmake some sacrifices to get it. So first of all, it\\'s clear\\nplastic, not glass, at the back. Which, you know, I\\'m sure Zach will get to\\nthis phone at some point, but I think it\\'ll be easier\\nto scuff and scratch, but harder to shatter,\\nlike glass would be, so, but I think it\\'s a\\nreasonable trade off. It\\'s also a textured\\nplastic frame as well, so it looks like aluminum, but it\\'s this plastic all\\nthe way around the phone, to the point where this phone\\nactually ends up feeling surprisingly light in the\\nhand for how big it is. But we should just get to that, this is a huge, it\\'s a\\njumbo-sized phone, it\\'s gigantic. Some people might not love that, but I think a lotta people\\nlike really big screens, and you get the natural advantages that come with a big phone, which is a big battery and a big screen. So this is a relatively\\ngiant 6.7-inch display corner to corner. It\\'s literally ultra phone size. And it gets pretty bright too, so definitely not flagship bright, \\'cause we have some\\ncrazy numbers these days, but 1300 knits peak brightness is very visible in bright indoor lighting, and bezels are even all the way around the front of the phone, so, aesthetically, I have no complaints. And then even at this price, it\\'s AMOLED, it has an optical fingerprint\\nreader under the glass. Its variable refresh rate up to 120 hertz. And it even has 2160 hertz PWM dimming. So if you don\\'t like\\nthe back of this phone, at least the front of it, that you\\'re actually\\nlooking at all the time, is pretty impressive for 350 bucks. But I\\'d say an even bigger\\nstrength to this phone is battery life. So battery always comes from\\nthree main things, basically, obviously having a huge physical battery. Also good software and an efficient chip. We\\'ll get to the software. But, this phone has a\\n5000-milliamp hour battery, that\\'s literally bigger than their flagship phones from Nothing, so, really big battery. It doesn\\'t have wireless charging, but it does have 45-watt wire charging. Which is pretty good, that\\'s\\nzero to full in an hour. And the chip it\\'s running\\nis this little thing called the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro. So, this was my biggest\\nquestion mark, actually, going into testing this phone, \\'cause, you know how Nothing teases the specs and stuff ahead of time. So we find out it\\'s a MediaTek chip, and I\\'m not sure if this\\none\\'s going to perform the way I\\'ve been used\\nto some other phones, like they\\'re showcasing\\nall these, you know, specifically handpicked\\nbenchmarks results, of course they will, but\\nconveniently, they only compare it to a two-year-old Nothing Phone 1 which had that mid-range,\\n778G Plus from Qualcomm. Now, I\\'m not expecting\\nflagship stuff for 350 bucks, but like, what\\'s it gonna land at, this feels like a make or\\nbreak part of the phone. And I\\'ve been pleasantly surprised. Now, it\\'s not gonna win\\nany prizes with raw specs, and I definitely don\\'t think\\nit\\'ll earn anybody\\'s money with the benchmark scores alone, you look at those numbers, you\\'re like \"Okay, not\\na total shock here.\" But as far as actual performance,\\nwhen you use the phone, the way I\\'d put it is, it\\'s respectable, and I really feel like that is\\na testament to the software, and how well it\\'s working together. So, at this point we\\'re on Nothing OS 2.5, on top of Android 14. And you already have seen\\nNothing Phone software with the dots and the\\naesthetic and all that stuff, but, it\\'s clean, there\\'s no bloat wear, and there is a solid\\nfocus on fast and smooth, it kinda feels like a throwback to the old OnePlus Magic back in the day. But with regular use, this phone\\nis quite smooth and snappy. Sometimes a fingerprint\\nreader shudders a little bit, like when you\\'re first unlocking, but for the most part, if you\\'re just using the phone\\ndoing stuff like messaging or flipping through a couple\\napps, email, web browsing, taking your pictures,\\nthis is a smooth phone. It\\'s pretty similar to what they did with the Nothing Phone 1, with this 778. It\\'s very solid with everyday use, and the second you try to\\ndo super high-end stuff, like gaming, then you\\'ll see where the\\nbenchmarks come up short, where you start dropping\\nframes and all that. But, again, this is a $350 phone and I am definitely not\\ncomplaining about that. Now Nothing has had some time now to build up their aesthetic\\nand their identity and what they really want\\na Nothing phone to be. And I gotta say, they\\nhave a lot of unique, really identifiable things going on here that you may like or dislike,\\nbut they\\'re all here. So aesthetically they\\'ve\\ngot the dots everywhere. So the stock apps have\\nthis dots aesthetic, and the thin font to go with it. The back arrow in Android\\nis made of these dots. And they have this extensive\\nbuilt-out selection of Nothing widgets now, most of them with the dots theme as well, so you can have this very\\nconsistent home screen aesthetic. And then there\\'s other little stuff, like you can enlarge a single app icon to fill up four spots on your home screen for a unique home screen grid. I don\\'t know, you might be into that. There\\'s also this nice little animation with the folders on the home screen. Also this new thing which\\nlets you add a glass effect to your wallpaper, so it\\'s blurred behind your home screen for better visibility, I\\nactually really like that. There\\'s also AI wallpapers now, so you can jump into the wallpaper studio and create the most soulless combo art the world has ever seen\\nin just a few taps. There\\'s also third-party icon pack support on the home screen, with\\ninstant one-touch previews. And then of course the glyphs. So, this phone still has\\nsome lights on the back, it\\'s less lights that the\\nflagship, than the phone two, but, about the same\\namount of functionality. So there\\'s one vertical\\nlight on the right, and a small one down\\nhere on the bottom left, and then the big top one\\narcing around the top left. This is the one that works\\nwith the glyph countdown timer. Maybe you\\'ll find that useful. The blinking notification\\nglyph when your phone is down, I still wish I could just\\ncustomize it a little bit more, I know they don\\'t wanna do\\nRGB, but if this was RGB, I would totally have different colors light up for different app notifications and I would go to town\\nwith that, but, you know, it still works with just white lights. And it also does music visualizations to sync up with any music\\ncoming out of the speaker, so... (phone plays electro-R&B music) I don\\'t know. Sure. Obviously some of this stuff is gimmicks. Some of this you may find\\nuseful like once or twice, I almost never use the countdown clock, but the one time I use\\nit, it\\'s kinda cool. Side note, I couldn\\'t\\nget the glyph composer to work at all on this phone. The UI worked, but it didn\\'t light up\\nthe lights on the back. But you know, on super closeup photos, maybe the glyph fill flash\\nis decently useful sometimes, useless other times. But hey, while we\\'re on\\nthe subject, the camera. The cameras on the back\\nhere are serviceable, like, it\\'s just practical to have cameras on the back of your phone, and these, they\\'re not\\ngood, but, they\\'re fine. I always feel like we go\\ninto budget phone reviews kinda knowing, okay, this isn\\'t gonna have\\ncameras that blow me away, it\\'s not gonna be as\\ninteresting to test these, but, you gotta test \\'em anyway\\nand see what they\\'re made of, so, this has a different new 50-megapixel primary\\ncamera on the back, and then it has the same ultra-wide camera as the Nothing phone too, and actually also the same selfie camera. And look, it can take okay pictures. Alright, passable pictures. I know 50 megapixels is a big number, but, here\\'s what I\\'ll say: at this level, even in great lighting, the photos aren\\'t particularly sharp. The dynamic range or depth\\nof field aren\\'t amazing. Like, you\\'re not buying this phone to take the greatest most\\nartistic photos and videos the world has ever seen. But, what you do need is\\nfor it to be serviceable, to be quick enough for autofocus to work, for it to capture a moment,\\ndocument scanning, video calls, sharing photos with people. And it does all that,\\nand it\\'s totally fine, and I can\\'t complain. And really what\\'s left a\\nbigger imprint on me using this is that, compared to their\\nother flagship phones, almost all of the features are still here. Like the only one I\\'m not actually seeing on this budget version of\\nthe phone is macro mode. And that, that theme of\\nkeeping a lotta the stuff from the more expensive phones and not doing these artificial cuts, that\\'s what feels good about\\nthis phone as a budget phone, to me, it actually feels like\\nthey\\'re trying to give people all of the Nothing phone\\nexperience for less money. Now, we definitely can\\'t\\nsay it\\'s one-to-one, there\\'s obviously cuts,\\nespecially with hardware, Like there\\'s no wireless\\ncharging, like I said. It\\'s IP54 instead of IP68. It\\'s plastic instead\\nof glass and aluminum. But, I like that once you\\nstart to get to use the phone, especially with the software\\nfeatures, experience wise, I don\\'t feel nearly as many\\nartificial-feeling cuts as we\\'ve seen on other phones. Like there\\'s no pro mode in the camera that\\'s missing from the budget phone. All the same advanced settings,\\nthe experimental features, all the home screen\\nfeatures with Nothing OS, it\\'s all here, on this cheaper phone. And the crazy part to me is, they obviously wanna compare\\nthis to a lower-end phone, so they compare it to the Phone 1, and my natural instinct is\\nlike, \"I\\'m ignoring that, \"of course they\\'re comparing\\nit to the old phone.\" But when, you actually look\\nat that 2-year-old phone, you kinda see how far they\\'ve come. And you look at the things that are actually better\\nabout this budget phone. This Nothing Phone 2A has\\na bigger, brighter screen, with thinner bezels. It has a larger battery,\\nwith faster charging, a higher-processor clock speed, a higher-resolution front camera, and a wider variety of refresh\\nrates than the Phone 1. Like, no wonder they\\nwanna show us the Phone 1. But, in general, if you\\'re\\nlooking for the TLDW, yes, this is a good, solid,\\nall-around budget phone. And the way Nothing has\\nbeen tracking with software, it appears, I mean they\\'re promising three years of Android\\nupdates with this phone. I think this will be a\\ngood budget phone to own for the next couple years. Well done, Nothing. Well done. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one.

      "[Document(page_content=\"down down down down Samsung Galaxy S one of the most popular names in the world of smartphones and has been for years interestingly it's kind of a long name you might be wondering where Galaxy s comes from and if you think you already know what you're thinking is probably wrong apparently Galaxy comes from a wine often enjoyed by highlevel Samsung Executives and then they proceeded to name like 20,000 phones after it now here's the thing Samsung will try anything that's kind of their thing like this is something I've known about them for a long time from reviewing their phones but just from researching for this video like they have a ton of phones in every single imaginable price bracket or feature set or spec sheet here you can even try to guess these they've had a Samsung Galaxy F series what do you think the F stands for stands for fun then there's the Galaxy Z series Z for zero and Galaxy m is you'd think midrange but it actually stands for Millennial and then Galaxy a that's some of their most popular affordable smartphones so naturally it stands for Alpha there's galaxy W for Wonder Galaxy R for Royal the list goes on but then the flagship that's lived at the top of their lineup is the Samsung Galaxy S and S stands for super smart yeah super smart anyway the first ever Samsung Galaxy S comes out in 2010 just to set the scene like this is 3 years after the first ever iPhones come out so the iPhone 4 is about to come out this is a couple months after the Nexus 1 gets unveiled Blackberry is quicking in their boots like the entire smartphone industry if you want to call it that is totally in a reshuffling things are up for for grabs and it's still very much in its infancy too the second most popular phone selling by volume looks like this it's a Nokia 3720 classic and so Samsung launches the first ever Galaxy S super smart into the world with over two dozen variations this is going to be a bit of a theme here you know it a pretty basic phone big touchcreen on the front some capacitive buttons a plastic removable back a single camera today we have Samsung Galaxy s24 and it's Ultra refined tightly packed supercomputer in the palm of your hands with high resolution cameras and displays powerful processors AI features like just a ton of optimizations that have stacked up over the years to get to this point so today I've got every single Samsung Galaxy S that has ever been released they're all in front of me actually it's every main Galaxy S variant from the S1 to the s24 everything in between and I'm going to review them all and some of them I've reviewed before and others are like the first time I've ever gotten them working on camera but either way it'll be fun to go back and go through this is the story of how we got to where we are today and where it started so buckle up we're going to Jump Right In also stay tuned for the graphs at the end like usual they're super fun so Samsung Galaxy S this is the first one summer 2010 and yeah it does clearly look old with the classic four capactive buttons at the bottom Android .1 and it's a micro USB port at the top next to the headphone jack but I feel like right off the bat you can see Samsung differentiating itself here first of all this is a reasonable display this is a 4-in screen and it's a Samsung made AMOLED display so that's a huge deal back in these days you could see a meaningful difference in battery life just if you set a wallpaper with a bunch of black in it because the pixels didn't have to light up on the OLED and that was A New Concept back then it's also only a 1500 mAh battery so every bit of savings you can get means a lot also of course this was back in the day when you could just pop the back off any phone and just take the battery out swap it out at any moment have two batteries if you want to swap them in and out real quick while the others are charging we will witness the death of this feature during this video but then using this phone now like okay it feels slow obviously but it's not really in the laggy or unresponsive way it's just slow like there's a lot of solid waiting for anything to happen especially heavier stuff like the web browser or opening the camera you just have to slow down a little bit give it a second even though this launched with what at the time was the fastest Graphics processing of any smartphone thanks to a Samsung made chip inside oh and speaking of cameras it launched with a single 5 megapixel camera on the back which was capable of shooting actually 720p video right out the box it asks for a memory card to do a lot of things like shooting videos because it only comes with two or 4 gigs of storage out the box but there's a Micro SD card expandable storage slot in the back of the phone so you can go right up to 32 gigs right off the bat so I never used one of these phones but my favorite thing about it now is it it's kind of got the modern shape already it has like kind of flat sides and a flat back there is no camera bump uh there is a small bump in the plastic actually over the rear-facing speaker because it was common to put your phone down on a table or something and without that bump it would block the speaker and so that bump literally is just to keep the speaker open so you can always hear your sound now you remember how I was saying Samsung will kind of just try anything that's been true since the first one like this first ever Galaxy S launched with like I said over a dozen variants and so you might recognize this one as the Samsung Galaxy S Stratosphere and you can tell because this is the one with a little Verizon stamp on its forehead here but you might have had the Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant that's what it would be called if you got the variant that was made for T-Mobile or the Samsung Galaxy S Epic 4G which is what they call the one that launched on Sprint now in hindsight honestly it feels like this was Samsung's way of just getting around carrier exclusives cuz they basically just made a slightly different version of this phone for every carrier in America with a little bit of a different design and a little bit of different features only Samsung only Samsung little did they know this would be the beginning of a whole empire so the sequel the first sequel is a Samsung Galaxy S2 second gen can teach you a lot so right away a couple things this phone is no notably bigger and noticeably sleeker than the first Galaxy S and these were back in the days where the percentage increases year-over-year with some of the stuff they did was crazy on paper like this went from a 1 GHz chip to a 1.2 GHz dual cord chip so that's just more than double the processing power it also went from a 4in screen to a 4.3in screen it goes from a 5 megapixel 720p camera to an 8 megap camera on the back shooting 1080p it doubled the ram up to a gbyte it bumped up to a 1,650 mAh battery and the amount of Base storage I guess you would say ouled from 2 gigs all the way up to 16 and it did all that in a phone that got thinner and it also added NFC so it added pieces and now this is an 8 and2 mm phone so this is one of the thinnest phones in the world at the time that it came out now the starting price also did go up a lot from $3.99 to $5.49 but this phone did launch into a relative success this sold like 3 million units in the first 2 months this was definitely the first one to show up on my radar I never owned one of these phones but I definitely saw it and thought about it but then this next one the Galaxy S3 in 2012 this is the first Samsung Galaxy S that I actually owned and I remember loving this thing I remember it well too the jump up and size again was very real so it's all the way up to a 4.8 in phone now which believe it or not like this is starting to push the limits of what people considered an appropriate phone size cuz I remember around this time there were a lot of phones that that were hitting exactly 4.65 in like that was a popular phone screen size for the big phones at the time and anything near 5 in kind of felt like weird like a tablet size and here's Samsung's flagship pushing 4.8 in of screen and then the four capacitor buttons down at the front are now just three buttons the search button's gone so it's a home button that's a physical button with back button on the right and menu on the left and this is also the first time we got a voice assistant on the phone and they called it SVO clever I know this is a a pretty direct response to we just got Siri announced on the iPhone the year before but you know S Voice s for Samsung they also use S for a bunch of other stuff S Notes so Samsung voice S Voice Now S Voice wasn't good but then again neither were any of the other voice assistants that were coming out so this is mostly just people poking around asking it to do things random facts just weather things like that what turned out to be much more significant with this phone is just this super sleek design the whole thing is shaped like a thin Pebble that you could probably skip across a lake it's inspired by Nature the whole OS leaned into that it had a ton of water droplet sounds everywhere the lock screen went from swipe to unlock to dragging your finger through this water like it was a pretty strong theme for them but I remember using this phone and reviewing it this is back in college for me I loved it it was also received very well and the combo of like being super slim and fast and having a huge OLED and S Voice had it starting to get touted like the iPhone killer um but I think more interestingly they thought this phone was big enough to Warrant an S3 Mini cuz this is a 4.8 in screen like I said kind of giant and so they came out with the one with a 4in display Galaxy S3 Mini at the same time cuz of course they did but the next year we got Samsung Galaxy S4 which was the beginning of a lot of things what do I feel like the fourth generation of any major new product is like the defining one this is this one's no exception now of course they're still making gigantic leaps on paper with specs cuz these little pocket computers are getting more and more capable of everything they do so it goes from a 4.8 in 720p screen to being one of the first phones with a 5 in 1080P screen in the age of a bunch of new retina displays that are aiming for the best pixel density then they also had variance all the way up from 1.4 to 1.9 GHz dual core processors it again doubled the Ram from 1 to 2 gb and that single back camera went from 8 megapixels to 13 megapixels so this is the first time you could take 1080p videos from the camera on the Galaxy S and then watch them on the 1080p screen on the front of the Galaxy S pretty sick this also goes from a 2,000 mAh battery to a 2600 mAh battery still removable uh a 30% increase is pretty crazy but again they just keep aiming for one day of battery life that's been a theme since this long ago like yes these things get more and more powerful every year and they're doing more and more stuff but as long as I can hit one day of battery life they seem cool with that now if you want more proof of Samsung just trying a ton of things this phone had a ton of random features some of them actually are kind of interesting cuz they feel like the the AI features of back in this day so like this is the phone that tried head tracking smart scrolling so when you're reading something you can tilt your head forward and backward to scroll through the page it's just insane it had smart rotation so this is actually cool if you have auto rotate on but you're looking at the screen while reading something and then turn sideways it won't rotate the screen it'll keep it right side up Smart Pause is fun you're watching a video you look away from the screen it'll automatically pause you look back it'll play again so there's lots of stuff like this some of it sticks some of it doesn't fine but this was also partially used to justify another increase in price for this phone so S4 at launch I don't know if you remember this it launched at $650 this is also the first time Samsung made an active version of the phone so another variant so Galaxy S4 Galaxy S4 Active so this added IP67 certification and a more rugged design it was a TFT LCD display instead of AMOLED and it traded some other small downgrades for like physical buttons and a slightly thicker phone with some flaps to cover the ports I'll tell you what was not really a major hit though this was one of the first major incidents of a Samsung phone battery swelling Catching Fire and burning up on someone now it didn't go happen to a ton of people it wasn't enough to become a major Trend but it's something to sort of remember for the future foreshadowing now by the time we get to Galaxy S5 Samsung is starting to hit their stride I think with the Galaxy S another huge battery bump now it's up to 2800 milliamp hours and another huge screen bump all the way up to 5.1 in diagonally and across the board this is uh I think fully Flagship in every dimens mention it's a it's a 2.7 GHz processor on some variants all right 2 to 3 gigs of RAM up to 32 gigs of storage and it's a 16 megapixel camera that now shoots 4K video also the bottom left button has gone from a menu button to a multitasking button to match the three primary buttons needed to operate Android but also says a lot about what it's capable of but then of course alongside all that is the absolute classic Samsung just trying things and I think the Telltale sign for this stuff like is when you see them try it for one generation just to throw it at the wall and see what sticks and then it's gone the next year like they added this little sensor back here next to the camera flash on the back that's a heart rate sensor so you could measure your heart rate plugs into S Health that didn't last very long they also added this weird texture for the first time to this plastic back that you know made it a little softer yes but also totally made it look like a Band-Aid plus it even came in this flesh color that also didn't stick around long they also added a fingerprint reader to the home button fun fact back in these days you actually had to swipe your whole finger across the home button to get it read of course fingerprint readers have stuck around but it doesn't have to be swiped anymore so that's improved significantly and you can see this weird port at the bottom here the Galaxy S5 has a sort of a double Port basically it could be used as just normal micro USB for charging but if you wanted full USB 3.0 data speeds there was a special like double-ended cable you could plug in to use all the pins and get that kind of weird that didn't stick around long either also there was a a flap on the bottom of all these phones for water resistance and they were super easy to fall off and this one also fell off naturally they also released both an active and a separate sport version of this phone alongside the regular Galaxy S5 of course they did so Samsung Galaxy S6 came out in 2015 but truthfully this was the beginning of a new era for Samsung phones you can look at it and see it this this is when they entered the modern age for better for worse so this phone was the first one with a fully glass back instead of plastic which yes made it their first non- removable back ke all the outrage in the comments of every YouTube video at the time but it also added uh wireless charging and they dropped these metal rails and metal buttons on the sides that felt way more solid than all the plastic we were working with on all the flagships that came before it and this phone is Sleek like footprint wise it's literally the same size as an iPhone 15 Pro from today but turn it sideways and it's one of the slimmest phones ever thanks to having a 2550 mAh battery yes that's actually smaller than the previous year now this is a recipe to make enthusiasts particularly mad when you go backwards it's not great so they heard that this went from a 2800 to a 2500 milliamp battery and it's not removable anymore and it also no longer has the micro SD card for expansion of your storage and on top of that you also went from that weird USB 3.0 thing down technically to USB 2.0 but aside from that this still did feel like their first really modern piece of Hardware this is also the first time we're getting a 1440p AMOLED display it's crazy sharp already we haven't seen a higher resolution since then and it's also the first Galaxy S Flagship with Optical image stabilization in the primary camera so this is a really big camera upgrade and it was the first Galaxy S Flagship to use 64-bit processing I do remember there was a lot of positive reception around this phone obviously from being well put together in metal and glass now and having good features and just generally being the same price as the previous year I just feel like there was one thing holding it back especially Among Us critical reviewers from being the obvious best Android phone available at that time and her name was TouchWiz see around this time there were also some other big Enthusiast Android options like Nexus 6p and 5x which were stock Android and then there was HT C1 M9 just down the street with their own HTC software LG G4 was out with their own software it's like every Android device scen at this time when it comes out it's like what are the specs what are the features what's the design and then what is the Android skin that you have to deal with to get it now Touchwiz has gotten better over time it's you know a little less bloop nature sounds but it's still absolutely a skin on top of Android rather than super integrated into Android itself which can make performance feel a little slow it can slow down how quickly updates come to this phone over time because they've got to go through Samsung but it gives you a bunch of extra features in return So at the time if you go back if you watch my videos around the phones at this time I always preferred like stock Android OEM just straight from Google it's always the fastest updates and it just felt the cleanest and most coherent where Samsung TouchWiz just had this this colorful cartoony look to it this feel to it it was a little cluttered but it it had the features it had What mattered anyway with S6 they also tried a little thing called the S6 Edge and Edge Plus because there was this war being fought at the time every time you saw a keynote with a new smartphone announcement they always mentioned screen to body ratios and so every Flagship if they can improve the best number they would always brag about the screen to body ratio how thin their bezels are and the best phones at the time were hovering around 70% meaning 70% of the front of the device is screen and the bigger that number the cooler the phone looks so this S6 Edge thing came along and it's another bit of Samsung Innovation just trying some stuff but they literally bend the OLED display right over to the edges of the phone and use curved glass to make it look like the display is like bleeding right over the edges of the device hence the edge name obviously there's still a bezel but it kind of worked it looked really cool uh this actually came at first from when when they originally tried it in the Galaxy Note which they had it on one side of the screen which is some like software tickers they literally put like a stock ticker on the side of the phone they would try anything to see if it worked and when it did they put it on both halves and now it's on the Galaxy S and it felt like the flagship thing so this phone got up to a 76% screen to body ratio with the S6 Edge Plus this is starting to feel like the top of a flagship lineup now Galaxy S7 was a kind of an incremental year in between you know holding it now you can tell they didn't really feel the need to change too much like it's the same size same screens and resolutions same storage sizes up to 128 gigs and they actually brought back expandable storage by popular demand so I guess you can talk Samsung into some stuff and you still can't take the back off this thing but they went ahead and added a Micro SD card slot on the SIM card tray which is clever but what I feel like they really realized this year is two things one wow you can really shove a lot of batteries in these things and two The Edge is the flagship people love the edge people just love the screen melting over the sides things so they're going to do a lot more of it so the regular S7 was great but the S7 Edge had a 3,000 mAh battery and the S7 Edge Plus had a 3600 mAh battery and then the S7 active had a 4,000 milliamp battery but for reference this is also the same year that the Galaxy Note 7 came out so you may recall the issues that plague the phone and its 3500 mAh battery the exact issue the reason why the note 7s started blowing up and having dangerous battery problems was specifically a design issue using a thin separator between two electrodes in a battery it was just damaged way too easily where wild reactions would occur when that damage happened for as many gates as we've had for smartphones like Ben gate whatever this has to be the greatest PR disaster in the history of smart phones like I think by a long way like people this got banned on planes like people would just ask do you have a Samsung phone like I don't think you want to take that on the plane it was literally recalled worldwide they took all of them back they couldn't sell it anymore it's a big issue and honestly a lot of tech companies would never recover from that but Samsung at this point was established enough they were big enough they were trying enough new things that they could weather that storm which is impressive then Samsung Galaxy S8 this is one of my favorite phones they added a lot of things to this phone now still classic Samsung thrown an absolute metric ton of stuff at the wall to see what sticks now I definitely didn't love all the stuff that they tried but I love that they were trying stuff and they tried so many things that these phones just feel a world apart so first of all there was an S8 and an S8 plus and both have fully curved Edge displays so Samsung's realized that this Advantage is received really really well and they can just keep touting their massive screen to body ratios plus they've refined their EDG screen apps feature it's subtle it's out of the way but it's useful for those who want to take advantage of it then they also tried this new pressure sensitive layer underneath the display right around the home button so the display can always respond to pressures in this area no matter where you are even while the screen is off now this is also as you may have guessed right around the time that Apple was trying 3D touch or Force touch in the iPhone and both of these didn't last very long but they tried and they also tried a slightly taller narrower 18 1 12 by9 aspect ratio which actually did nicely keep the ever growing screen size to be pretty reachable uh since they've also gone from capacitive buttons below the screen to all onscreen buttons so now talk about screen to body ratio like we are really cooking they also switched to USBC for the first time sick easy win people are asking for that last year anyway but then with that they also tried this thing called Dex which is like if you plug that USBC Port into a computer computer monitor you get this whole computer UI which just uses the phone as like a trackpad and then you might have noticed the extra button here on the left hand side so fun fact for the entire history of every single Samsung Galaxy S so far they have always had power button on the right hand side volume rocker on the left hand side and that's still true here but they've added a button underneath the volume rocker and yeah that's that's the Bixby button so Bixby is the new voice assistant replacing SVO on Samsung phones and Samsung really leaned in hard with this one so not only did it get a dedicated button to activate it all the time but the camera also now has Bixby Vision which is kind of like a an awkwardly specific competitor to Google lens and this is Samsung really leaning into the whole AI assistant thing for the first time and I would say to mixed success then they also tried a fingerprint reader on the back of the phone this time since there's no home button anymore love that and then they also tried this this plastic Snap-on keyboard which I think honestly might be in my top five worst smartphone accessories of all time but even after all of that I think the most important or the most impactful decision for this phone for Galaxy S8 was their choice to use Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in some regions and Samsung's own made exos chips in other regions now at the time or even in hindsight this was a pretty smart move maybe even ahead of their time because this is Samsung going all right we want to make our own chips for our phones so so that we can maximize the efficiencies and all the the power and the things that we do in our phones we want them to all be built by us and also to not give Qualcomm so much money while we're at it but also in hindsight this failed spectacularly this was like an ongoing thing they really wanted to do but because they didn't go all exos right from the get-go they split it they had some exos and some Snapdragon the Snapdragon phones would consistent L and regularly outperform the exos version of the same phone across the board better performance better efficiency better battery better heat it literally got to the point where prospective buyers would jump into subreddits and forums to try to find where they could import a Qualcomm version of the phone instead of the xnos one available in their own country and there are a whole bunch of tutorials on if you're buying a secondhand one how do you know which version you're getting just based on the serial number just so you can avoid the exos version like I said in hindsight ahead of their time a bit here but big backfire nevertheless there was lots of other stuff that was so new about this phone it Justified another increase in price all the way up to $750 that's today's prices so Galaxy S9 I'm going to say this was Peak Samsung Galaxy S I loved this galaxy S9 and again it was Galaxy S9 and S9 plus now this was a relatively incremental update versus S8 but you know slightly thinner bezels same Ram same storage but a slightly improved processor nice colors I like these colors and then they also moved that fingerprint sensor on the back from right next to the camera to right under the camera otherwise you know what basically the same thing but then they had to try some stuff so this time they tried this dual aperture thing with the camera and it was super cool basically it could snap between f1.5 wide open and f2.4 a variable aperture in a smartphone it's it's a clever little thing that would let you receive as much light as possible in low light situations but when you have plenty of light it would stop down to 2.4 and it would get more in focus it would be a sharper better looking photo and I remember I loved it when I used it other reviewers loved it when they used it and then it was gone from the next phone Samsung we missed this bring it back but honestly this is one of those phones picking it up now like I've talked about this before if you could bring back any old phone design from whatever year and just modernize it with new specs and new software I think between HTC1 M8 or M9 and this phone pretty good candidates this this thing is Sleek it's just a great size it's a 1440p OLED USB typc still has a headphone jack obviously the fingerprint reader is in a good spot just a really great overall package and I said as much in my original review back in 2018 now is it still Samsung software yeah but at this point there are so many features jammed in here that it's kind of undeniable the utility and yeah people are totally willing to live with it as long as you know what you're getting into with a Samsung phone fun fact this is also the year that Samsung unveiled the Galaxy home a small Weber grill shaped speaker designed to be an AI assistant in your house with Bixby it's been about 2,000 days since that announcement no word on it since then I don't think it's officially been cancelled maybe they just want us to forget about that one so then Samsung graduates to the Galaxy S10 this I think could be argued also maybe as Peak Samsung since they've now basically just gone full screen to the point where reviews are complaining about the last few millimeters of forehead and Chin like you see how the chin is just a tiny bit bigger but yeah up at the top we've gone right up to the earpiece and the selfie camera is now a cutout in the top right hand corner giving birth to a whole new genre of meme wallpapers screen to body ratio is approaching 9 0% now and we're basically just looking at Samsung's best-in-class 1440p AMOLED and not much else and now these phones have gotten irreversibly big S10 has a 6.1in display and the S10 plus would be 6.4 borderline tablet sized 10 years removed from the original but truly entering us into the Modern Age this is the first Samsung phone with more than one camera on the back and in Samsung fashion they just jump straight to three obviously so there's a primary camera a 2X telephoto camera and a0 5x Ultra wide phones would never look the same after this point every phone up until now so far has had just that tiny little camera bump just a single little circle or oval on the back but as soon as you open this box you're never going back cameras are now a feature on the back of a phone and you'll also notice there is no fingerprint reader on the back of this phone because this is also the first one that they tried that ultra Sonic fingerprint reader underneath the display glass and it's they pretty much nailed it right from the get-go I remember testing it and seeing if it will work underwater and if it was scratched at all it was fine it haven't really improved in much since these days so it seems like they nailed it they still use it but the thing that maybe brought this phone the most into the age of modern smartphones might just be the price so Samsung's been throwing a ton of stuff at the wall for years and now they've just built out this whole lineup but S10 starts at $900 when it comes out and then they have the S10 Plus which starts at a th000 they also had an S10 5G which was an even bigger even more expensive version of the phone with a bigger battery to support you know 5G radios because 5G is sort of burgeoning at this time expensive phones I think that actually is why one of my favorite new releases around this time was this little new thing they made called the s10e and this thing you know it's not quite a mini but this is where Samsung made a couple little corner cutting decisions to separate the true Flagship from something a little more budget friend so for $750 it has a slightly smaller and slower charging battery and a power button fingerprint reader instead of the ultrasonic unders screen one but honestly probably a better deal than the flagships that it was up against so now on to the next one Galaxy s20 and no we didn't skip any phones here basically 2020 is the year Samsung decided that they were going to sync up the year of the calendar with the year of the phone so we have s20 in 2020 I'm sure that has nothing to do with the fact that the number was always slightly behind the FL Flagship iPhone but now this galaxy s20 looks blank boring soulless what happened like this feels like this is a complete blank phone like if you put the S10 next to the s20 and then not to jump too far forward but the S21 it looks like they took a year off with the s20 like this might be the most generic phone of all time now to be fair there are other phones that have looked like this and again this is Samsung's flagship for years and we know they're going to start to play it safe but in hindsight this one is pretty dull it also happens to be the first ever Galaxy S since the very beginning to move the volume rocker to the right side that's a choice it also is the first one to not say the model number on the back at all with the text it's just blank and it's also the first Galaxy S to follow in the footsteps of the iPhone after making fun of them and removing the headphone jack also a choice now I do love that this was officially the first Galaxy S Flagship with 120 Herz display and they actually moved the smaller hole punch camera to the top middle and was the first to be able to record 8K video so it's still gaining capabilities it's not like the ball didn't move forward at all with this phone but probably the more interesting Dynamic is what was happening at the very top of the lineup see this is the first year of the Ultra phone so s20 still a regularized phone th000 phone but they also decided to make a gigantic phone with the most possible numbers and the highest 10 possible specs and make it an Ultra and this was kind of fighting at the top of the lineup with the Galaxy Note because up until this point you know they tried a whole bunch of stuff and they ended up having this particularly successful high-end phone with a stylus in it that was if you wanted even more than the S could offer you could go buy a Galaxy Note so this phone in this year kind of just like its design just kind of got forgotten until later in the year when they dropped The Fan Edition the Fe of the exact same phone cut a couple things things down 1080p removed like one or two features 700 bucks and this phone was a great deal this one my phone of the year but also fun not so fun fact uh this galaxy s20 has also started swelling like the battery has started to bulge to the point where it's pushing the back of the phone off of the chassis through the glue so I'll just say I've had a lot of smartphones come through the studio we review a lot of phones obviously and we've had basically a large sample size of smartphones in long-term storage and the only brand that's had more than one smartphone whose battery swells up like a balloon to the point where we have to get rid of it is Samsung but then the year was 2021 and Samsung drops Galaxy S21 definitely bringing us up to the current design language that is so recognizable as a Samsung phone so this triple camera is now on the corner of the back it's unmistakable now in fact this might be their best one with the metal piece melting over the sides and specifically this purple and gold color way I think it's kind of iconic this is also the beginning of the base models being extremely boring I'm calling it now like the the the action's way higher and lower in the lineup like the note fighting the ultra for Supremacy that's crazy also The Fan Edition and the a series kind of fighting each other to be the best overall value but sitting in the middle kind of in no man's land that just can't mess anything up and has to play it safe well that's exactly what the S21 did they actually bumped down to a 1080p display they are back to Flat displays now no more expandable storage in this model no more charger in the Box for this model whatever the industry is doing that's what they're doing like there's no leadership here there's just just enough brand cache that like if they make a Samsung version of the phone that everyone's buying in stores and put it next to that in the store people will just buy the Samsung one so Galaxy s22 is more along the same track slightly more boring colors slightly flatter edges all the way around but on the upside this thing also does basically have perfectly thin bezels all the way around at this point so I think the screen to body ratio now is well into the '90s and frankly I don't even care what the number is anymore I just feel like there's so little bezel to hold with my fingers that anything less wouldn't really make any sense so the bezel is effectively gone at this point it makes perfect sense to go back to the perfectly flat displays because Samsung has now realized and everyone else has realized that those curved displays they're kind of cool and they looked cool in the past but they were kind of a crutch to make the phone appear to have a larger screen to body ratio than it actually did but now that we have the tech to go right up to the edges and the corners you don't have to curve the display anymore it just looks sick and is flatter and is more durable so actually maybe the most notable change on the outside here is these phones are now slightly smaller than the previous year so it went from 6.2 and 6.7 in to 6.1 and 6.6 in for s22 and s22 plus and there is no doubt in my mind that that is specifically to give more room and a bigger Gap to the Ultra phone at the top of the lineup the ultra has been doing battle with the note it's winning it stole the Spen from it and so with these boring default base phones for 750 bucks flat totally fine just just look up there though there's some more expensive phones you can spend more money so the Galaxy s23 was interesting for one reason and one reason only no more exos version so every single Galaxy s23 and Galaxy s23 plus and s23 Ultra ships with the same slightly customized Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy and yeah performance is great you know for all the years that they've been trying to catch up the exos chip to the Snapdragon chip they finally gave up on it which you could argue is good news because everyone now gets the good Snapdragon performance and efficiency now but it's also kind of bad news because there's less competition there's that much less incentive for Qualcomm to do anything particularly great here the whole goal for exos chips was supposed to be better customization and integration and while we got rid of that they can still claim with s23 to have done at least some customization because they've like I said they've made it a 4 Galaxy chip so it's not quite the off-the-shelf one every else gets what's different slightly higher clock speeds slightly more powerful cuz they've got better Cooling in these phones so mission accomplished aside from that they've removed even more character by getting rid of the signature camera bump and making an even more generic and Universal appeal phone than ever before just same set of cameras same aspect ratio same features just slightly more battery in both versions nobody's saying these phones are bad they're just not not making exciting strides the way they used to back in the day which brings us to this year's Samsung Galaxy s24 even more boring colors and even more generic design and even more playing it safe than ever before this year it's the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 and this chip enables some pretty substantial AI features which they lean into it makes the phones really good stuff like live translation and generative photo editing call screening and my personal favorite Circle to search is awesome but a lot of the AI features are now making their way to some other phones and circle to search isn't an exclusive the pixel has that too and frankly aside from just getting flatter edges and slightly bigger batteries they share a lot of parts with the previous year's phones like the cameras uh the screen resolutions they bumped up a little bit but functionally the same screen to body ratios the same maybe the buttons are clicker maybe that's enough these phones are all grown up now so now we've seen the glow up the the different eras the plastic to the glass the iconic to the static but my favorite way to visualize all these different types of improvements is the graphs so welcome to my favorite section the graph section now before we jump fully in a quick word from our Channel sponsor dbrand fun fact they've been supporting these devices since the Galaxy S4 that is a long time now they're also supporting all the way up to Galaxy s24 and I think this year with these phones a lot of us were expecting to get ch2 support to get kind of like that ring of Mag safe style magnets but for whatever reason the Stars didn't align so this phone doesn't have that but with dbrands cases for the s24 series they all come with magnets built in so that means basically any ch2 or mag safe accessories will work on the s24 so they essentially give you that easy alignment on any wireless charger pretty sick uh you can check it out at the link below in the description so let's take a look at how far these phones have come these are really interesting and there's a couple of them I think Samsung is the first one one that has notable ups and downs in their progress graphs which is really interesting it kind of feels like they're going backwards but there's reasons behind all of it also this could be a way crazier graph because they obviously split out and Fork into a bunch of different models The Edge models the plus models the ultra models the active models but I'm just sticking with just the base models just for pure Simplicity of visuals so first up screen sizes so these are the screen sizes of the base Sam Galaxy S over every single year starting at the original 4in Samsung Galaxy S then really quickly jumping up into the fives and then kind of slowing down and settling in right around 6 in you can actually see a slight dip where the S10 was 6.1 in then it was 6.2 again then back to 6.1 to make room for the ultra then back up to 6.2 again feels like now there's a sort of a dedicated gigantic phone so this rate of growth has pretty much evened out so the huge phone is the ultra which is 6.8 in which is crazy but here's a fun fact based on this chart maybe it's not a fact but you can make an argument that the Galaxy s20 was kind of peak Samsung cuz that is the same screen size as today's Base phone but hold that thought let's look now at battery sizes so you know battery life hasn't really improved dramatically we're still at a day for a good phone but the physical capacity of these batteries able to fit in these phones has improved significantly as well so you can see it starts at500 milliamp hours removable of course and nearly doubles by the Galaxy S5 but then it dips right when they introduce the edge phones then they shoot back up again but again kind of flatlines in line with a certain memorable battery related event but then they eventually got the courage to walk back up the base phone all the way to 4,000 milliamp and what do you know again you can argue Galaxy s20 is Peak Samsung that's the first year of the 4,000 mAh battery and that is still the battery size again now the primary camera megapixel count this one's a little more interesting maybe a little more classic improvement over time of course megapixels don't mean everything but it's fun to see the priorities increase over time at the beginning there was a lot of incentive to just level up from 720p to 1080p video and then to 4K video but once we hit 8K you know there's not any reason to go too crazy with megapixels beyond that of course the highest end Ultra phones quickly blasted the ceiling way up all the way to 100 megapixels and then 200 this year which is nuts but for the Baseline phone you know most people's screens aren't 50 megapixels so I think this is a very appropriate Plateau but then last but not least starting price we all know what happened with smartphones over the years and here you can see it visualized the steep climb through 400 500 600 bucks right up to the $900 ceiling for the Bas Galaxy S this is the base phone now the most expensive phone has of course gotten dramatically more expensive too so again that ceiling lifting with the ultra has allowed Samsung to go way up to $1,300 starting and today you can pay 1660 for the 1 TB Galaxy s24 Ultra but that has at least helped bump the base price back down a little bit to the $799 of today so that's how we got from here to here from Galaxy S1 to s24 these videos are super fun to sort of look back and actually visualize that progress over time I also feel like I already know which one we want to do next get subscribed make sure you see that coming up either way thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace from two gigs all I deserve that\", metadata={'source': 'eKVTFXQPAhs', 'title': 'Reviewing EVERY Samsung Galaxy S Ever!',

      "Channel: Marques Brownlee\n",

      "[Document(page_content=\"(upbeat music) - So this smartwatch has one really interesting\\ntrick up its sleeve that I haven't seen in any\\nother, and that, honestly, I don't think we're ever gonna see again. So at this point we know what a smartwatch is already, right? This is a stable, mature category. They deliver mostly across the board on all the same functions. And aside from the one crazy trick, this one is no exception. This is the OnePlus Watch 2, three years after the\\noriginal OnePlus Watch and it costs 300 bucks. So for the $300 you're spending, you're getting a pretty\\nnice circular watch design. It comes in this black or\\nsilver stainless steel body and a sapphire cover glass over a 1.4 inch, 60 hertz AMOLED display. Design-wise, you could argue it takes cues from maybe the OnePlus 11 or the OnePlus 12 with\\nthe way the camera bump is melted into the side rail of the phone. They've done a similar thing here with the buttons on the side of the watch. So there's a circular button at the top and this rectangular button at the bottom. And I kind of like it. It's a nice shape. It's got this little\\nsubtle, classy variation of just the pure circle. And then the back looks\\npretty standard too. You got the four pins at the\\ntop, those are for charging. And it has all the sensors you'd expect for a smartwatch in the middle, optical heart rate sensor, pulse oximeter for blood oxygen, and of course, it still has\\nthe interchangeable bands, same as gen one. And the whole thing is actually both IP 68 dust and water resistant and reaches a US military\\nstandard for durability. Basically means it can also\\nwithstand extreme temperature and moisture and shock among other things.\\n(watch taps) It's not too heavy,\\nit's built pretty well. This display goes up to a\\nthousand nits peak brightness. So it looks good. It's\\nbuilt well across the board. Nice. So what's the catch? What's the weird twist? Well at the beginning I\\nmentioned like we already kind of know what a smartwatch is, which is a tiny computer on\\nyour wrist with a tiny screen and a tiny battery. And that's fine. Like they all tend to have\\npretty short battery lives just because they're so small, and so you kind of just\\ncharge 'em every day. And that's the way it is. Like the main competitors\\nhere are the Apple Watch, which is 18 hours, although that's not the\\nmost direct competitor 'cause that's the iPhone. But the Galaxy Watch, one of the best, 40 hours of battery, and the Pixel Watch, the newest one, 24 hours of battery life. But this one, OnePlus\\nis claiming 100 hours. 100 hour battery life in Smart Mode, which is not the battery saving mode, it's actually the\\ndefault mode out the box. 100 hours. So 96 hours is four days. I feel like, you know, 100 sounds cooler so they just went with 100. But four days of battery\\nsounds a lot less inconvenient. So, you know, I had to\\nput that to the test. So for the past four straight days I've been that guy walking around with both an Apple Watch Ultra, which claims 36 hours of normal use and this thing. Doing all the same stuff\\nwith both watches on, getting notifications, doing workouts, just poking around the UI. And by the end, I was actually\\nvery impressed with both. So the $800 Apple Watch Ultra actually over performed the\\n36 claimed hours for me. By hour 56 it was about ready to die. Now meanwhile, the OnePlus\\nWatch had about 15% left. Now you're probably thinking, wait, that's not even close to\\n100, it's like 50 something. But OnePlus told me that if you turn the always on display off, that's good for two more\\ndays of battery life, it's actually off by default. I turned it on for this test, but that would get you well\\nover the 100 hour mark. To be fair, that's also probably true about the Apple Watch Ultra. Now one detail to consider\\nthat I think actually mattered for this particular test. I've been wearing hoodies a lot 'cause it's that type of weather. And so even with the sleeves\\non this Chevron Hoodie, which I'll link it below 'cause you probably wanna check it out. It covers the watch. And so when you cover the\\nwatch with your sleeve, it thinks it's in the dark 'cause the light sensors are covered so it turns the brightness\\nway down on the watch. And so I think that's why it outperformed the battery numbers that it's claiming is 'cause I had a sleeve\\nover it a lot of the times and the brightness was low. But even still, this $300 watch outperformed this $800 smartwatch\\njust in terms of battery. Now here's the thing. The way that they're\\nachieving this battery life is, I think, more interesting\\nthan the battery life itself. This is the twist. See, most smart watches\\nhave a chip inside, computing everything, with some high powered cores\\nand some high efficiency cores to balance out power and battery life. This watch has two entirely\\nseparate processors and two different operating systems running for each of them. So there's a high powered\\nSnapdragon W5 inside, that's powering Wear OS 4 and that only lights up for\\nthings connected to that. Then there's also a BES 2,700 chip that is always on and runs RTOS. And they both share the\\nsame 32 gigs of base storage and two gigs of RAM. So Wear OS kicks on for\\nthe more intensive tasks like maps or music playback. But the RTOS that's always on is for those basic, low power tasks: heart rate monitoring, phone calls, notifications, background stuff. It's like a hybrid car. It's really interesting. And a fully electric car,\\nyou guys already know has all the benefits of\\nbeing really responsive but not the best range. But a gas car has a ton of range, just not as responsive as fully electric. So if you get a hybrid,\\nbest of the both worlds, responsive and range. And this watch, it's a hybrid\\nwith the best of both worlds, responsiveness and range. So I've been pretty impressed. You know, using this\\nthing, it's responsive. It has a ton of watch faces. There's a lot of custom workouts which look very familiar with tracking and everything that\\nstill sends all the data to the OHealth app in\\nplenty of detail for me. I do still wish now, shoveling\\nsnow was a workout type, but that's another story. But you know, these here are\\nregular weightlifting workouts. And also, can I say I\\nreally like that it is hold to end the workout, not tap to end. So it's way harder to\\naccidentally stop a workout. Great idea. Also another weird quirk, this button here has a crown that rotates. But that rotation doesn't\\nactually do anything. It doesn't change the volume, it doesn't scroll up or down in anything. It does nothing. It's not\\nconnected to anything. It just freely spins. apparently, that's\\nliterally just to make it more durable upon impact. Doesn't serve any function. Also, it does have this weird hitch, that it hasn't really\\ngotten any less annoying, which is if I get a notification, I feel the buzz on my wrist, then I lift up my wrist and it takes like a full two seconds to show me the notification I just got. Not that two seconds is a\\ndisaster, it's not a ton of time, but it's longer than you expect, and it kind of annoys me to have to wait in comparison to other watches, which will just show me the\\nnotification right away. And I feel like you can\\nactually see the moment that it fires up the Snapdragon W5 and Wear OS kind of snaps\\non right in front of you before it shows you that notification. It's very odd. But here's the other twist on top of everything we've already talked about. I don't think this dual chip system is all of the magic creating\\nthis great battery life, because this watch also has\\na 500 MilliAmp hour battery. Now 500 MilliAmp hours\\ndoesn't sound like a lot, but here's the sizes\\nof other smart watches in competition with this\\nand their battery sizes and how long they last. And it's a little bigger\\nthan you'd expect. Now if I gave the Pixel Watch 2, which also has a\\nSnapdragon W5, by the way. If I gave the Pixel Watch 2\\na 500 MilliAmp hour battery, do we think it would last 50 hours? I don't know, but there you go. Honestly, at the end of the day I just came away from\\nthis mostly just impressed that they actually kept the\\nprice of this watch so low. Because two chips and two OSs and the work that goes into that, I dunno, to me that just sounds expensive and it's really not missing\\nanything else too drastic. I think it's competitive in a\\nlot of good ways at 300 bucks. So I think the clear positives would be: a nice design, really classy\\nlooking design, nice display, dual frequency GPS, so\\nthat's for better accuracy, and then of course\\nreally good battery life. The four days we talked about is awesome, but if you put on power saver mode, it's up to 12 days of battery life. Now this is gonna disable a\\nlot of the Wear OS things, so it's just basic stuff,\\nexercises, heart rate monitoring, but you could get it to really\\nlast a week if you wanted to. But then the weaknesses are definitely the delay in\\nchecking your notifications. The haptics also aren't that nice, and there's no iPhone compatibility, but you already knew that. But I would also say the\\ncharger is not that cool. Honestly, it's kind of clunky. I mean it works perfectly\\nfine, don't get me wrong, but it's just like a big plastic block with pins and magnets in it. But it'll get you a full\\nday's charge in 10 minutes and a full charge in an hour. So that's acceptable. But for 300 bucks, I'd say\\nOnePlus has redeemed itself from its previous\\nefforts in smart watches. It's pretty good. Like in a world of smartwatch gimmicks, there's the one with earbuds inside, there's the one for fitness, there's the one for the iPhone. Maybe this is the one\\nwith the hybrid system and pretty good battery life. (upbeat music)\\nMaybe that's enough for you. Let me know in the comments below. Either way, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you the next one. Peace.

      "[Document(page_content='- [Will] That\\'s hot.\\n(bright upbeat music) - All right, so this is\\nsimultaneously really impressive and really frightening at the same time, and it\\'s hitting me in ways\\nthat I didn\\'t really expect. So do you remember Will\\nSmith eating spaghetti? Do you remember when this was what AI generated videos looked like? Remember when we said, \"Okay,\\nthis AI stuff is cool and all \"but clearly there\\'s a long way to go \"before there\\'s any need for concern.\" Well, welcome to the future people because this is also\\nan AI generated video. And so is this, completely\\nsynthesized out of thin air by computers. This one too, this is not real. Absolutely ridiculous how far we\\'ve come in literally one year. This does feel like another\\nChatGPT, DALL.E moment for AI. And maybe I\\'m overreacting because, okay, I am a video creator, so an AI that\\'s actually doing my job, maybe that feels a little more threatening so I\\'m particularly impressed by it. But also this stuff is really good. So today, Sam Altman and\\nOpenAI announced a new model called Sora and it can generate full up to one minute video\\nclips from just text input. So the same way DALL.E was able\\nto understand our text input and turn it into a photorealistic or stylized image or whatever you want, same thing with Sora but\\nnow since it\\'s videos, it also needs to understand how all these things like\\nreflections and textures and materials and physics\\nall interact with each other over time to make a\\nreasonable looking video. And of course, right away,\\nthere\\'s a bunch of examples on their website that are crazy. Now, before I show you these, I just need you to keep this in mind, you\\'re about to watch a\\nbunch of AI generated videos and you know that you\\'re about to watch a bunch of AI generated content. So your brain, you\\'re already\\nlooking for this stuff and it\\'s not perfect, you\\nwill find imperfections, but not everybody who\\nsees AI generated content on the internet knows\\nto be looking for that. So also keep that in mind. This is also the worst\\nthat this technology is going to be from here on out. So, okay, here\\'s one of the videos. There\\'s no audio to any of these clips, but the prompt for this one is a stylish woman walks\\ndown a Tokyo street filled with warm, glowing,\\nneon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress and black boots. This video is already miles\\nahead of where we were. It has accurate lighting,\\nit has materials, it has skin tones, movements, even has reflections all over the place. Now, of course, if you look at it for more than about 10\\nseconds, very closely, there are lots of giveaways. Like this dude in the background kinda looks like he\\'s\\ngliding in a weird way. The frame rates and the\\nreflections in the water are for some reason lower\\nthan the rest of the video. The camera movement overall\\nis just a bit inconsistent and it just, I don\\'t know, it just kinda feels a little bit off. But then again, this is\\nwhere we were one year ago. So just keep that in the back\\nof your head for all this. Okay, how about this one? This is another one\\nwhich has a long prompt about a camera following\\nbehind a white vintage SUV with a black roof rack as it\\'s\\nspeeds up a steep dirt road. This is also, again, really good. It kinda looks a little more video gamey because of how rock solid\\nthe drone footage is, but clearly very usable. Here\\'s another one, a litter of golden retriever\\npuppies playing in the snow. Their heads pop in and out\\nof the snow covered in it, it\\'s so good. It feels like the physics\\nof the fur and the ears and everything with the snow\\nflying around in slow motion is incredible. I\\'ve looked through all\\nof the sample videos on OpenAI\\'s website, and clearly these are\\nthe handpicked best ones that they chose to share where they just put in some text and then get a video and don\\'t modify it. But there\\'s really\\nimpressive stuff in there. Some of it has humans, some of it doesn\\'t. Some of it is more realistic feeling like the truck driving one, but some of them are more\\nvideo gamey or more stylized. A lot of it is slow motion, I just have to say how insanely fast these models are improving is genuinely, like that\\'s the shocking part. Like I remember not even that\\nmany months ago, DALL-E 3, really, really high end, and you could always still\\nfind something off about it. Like especially if you ask it for something like a\\nphotorealistic image of a human, something about like the hands or the ears would always just be a little bit off, nevermind the physics. But even this video here\\nis crazy at first glance. The prompt for this AI generated video is a young man in his 20s is sitting on a piece of a\\ncloud in the sky reading a book. This one feels like 90%\\nof the way there for me. Like it\\'s beyond the uncanny valley of like apple\\'s personas, which are actually based on humans. This is a made up person. I mean, his eyes are kinda weird, and the motion of the pages\\nin the book are kinda odd. And yeah, obviously, he\\'s in\\na cloud and that\\'s a giveaway but like, the lighting and\\nthe shadows and the skin tones and then all the realism of\\nthe textures on the shirt and the way the shirt and\\nthe pants move and the hair, they\\'re all really impressive. And then for this one, they typed in a movie trailer featuring the adventurers\\nof the 30-year old spaceman wearing a red wool knitted\\nmotorcycle helmet, blue sky, salt desert, cinematic style,\\nshot on 35 millimeter film. And the closeups of his face,\\nthe fabrics on the helmet, the film grain through every\\nshot and the cinematic style, this is one of the most\\nconvincing AI generated videos I\\'ve ever seen, minus\\nmaybe the weird physics of that dude walking\\nkind of in fast motion. So Sam Altman, if you\\nfollow him on Twitter, he\\'s going through a whole bunch more of like people\\'s requests and posting a bunch more generated videos. And so if you wanna check out his profile, you can see those. But here\\'s the thing about\\nthese AI generated videos now, as good as they\\'ve gotten to this point, they can and will pass as real videos to people who are not looking\\nfor AI generated videos. Now that is obviously insanely sketchy during an election year in the U.S. and also terrifying for a bunch of other\\ninternet related reasons but it\\'s also perfect for stock footage. Like there are already\\nall kinds of presentations and advertisements and then PowerPoints that are in need of oddly\\nspecific stock videos. And these AI generated videos\\nare already good enough to 100% pass for that purpose. Like look at this one,\\nthis one with the waves at Big Sur, this drone shot. Honestly, if I saw this on Twitter, I wouldn\\'t even think twice. I\\'d be like, \"Oh, nice drone shot, dude.\" Wouldn\\'t even think about\\nAI if I wasn\\'t pixel peeping at like the way the water was moving. Like this is a totally\\nusable video in an ad for some California based product. And that has all sorts of\\nimplications for the drone pilot that no longer needs to be hired, for all the photographers\\nand videographers whose footage no longer\\nneeds to be licensed to show up in that ad that\\'s being made. It\\'s already that good. There\\'s other stuff like this wall of TVs, which would be a totally\\nexpensive and difficult thing to shoot with a camera and\\nall these old expensive props, but if you can just generate\\nit this well with reflections and the environment and\\neverything else around it, I mean, why do it any other way? It\\'s also very capable of\\nhistorical themed footage. So this is supposed to be\\nCalifornia during the Gold Rush. It\\'s AI generated but\\nit could totally pass for the opening scene in an old Western with the right music over it. How long until an entire ad, every single shot is\\ncompletely generated with AI? Or what about an entire YouTube\\nvideo or an entire movie? I\\'m tempted to say like we\\'re\\na long way away from that because you know, this\\nstill has flaws clearly and there\\'s no sound, and there\\'s a long way to go\\nwith the prompt engineering to iron these things out. But then again, the spaghetti\\nwas like a year ago. Now actually like that\\nOpenAI, on their website, they show some of the downfalls too of this particular model. And because who would know better than the people who have been using it? This is a very private\\ntool, by the way, right now. It\\'s in super limited access, so it\\'s in the hands of red teamers, which basically means people\\ntesting it, pushing the limits, trying to break it, and\\na few trusted creators. But they have found plenty\\nof weird edge stuff. Like this clip here of a\\nbunch of gray wolf pups looks normal at first but then it\\'s pretty clear\\nthat something\\'s kinda off with the way they\\'re just\\nkinda appearing out of nowhere and walking through each other. That\\'s kinda weird. Or this clip of a guy\\nrunning on a treadmill, which I mean, I don\\'t\\nreally have to say much more about why this one is weird. But this is my favorite one, again, so again, just try to put\\nyourself in the mind of someone who\\'s not expecting AI. You\\'re just scrolling through Facebook or Twitter or something, right? So you just see this video. So first I just want\\nyou to watch this clip as if it\\'s just a stock video you found of a grandma celebrating her birthday. And just try to think like, I wonder what birthday\\nshe\\'s celebrating, right? I don\\'t know, how old do you think she is? 60? 65? Maybe it\\'s the big 70. She seems to really like that cake. Now, did you see it? Did you catch that? I\\'m gonna play it again, but this time, watch the video knowing that AI generated\\nphotos and videos have trouble accurately doing hands. I\\'ll play it again. And now it feels super obvious\\nlike every time you watch it, watch a different set of hands,\\nit gets weirder and weirder. You can watch it like five\\ntimes and there\\'s dead giveaway after dead giveaway, not even mentioning the\\nweird inconsistencies with the direction of\\nthe wind on the candles. But even as I\\'m saying all that, even as it\\'s coming outta my mouth, I can\\'t help but remember\\nthat 12 months ago we were critiquing this. (Will laughing) So what does this all mean? Well, I mean, there\\'s what it means now and there\\'s what it means for the future. Now, Sora, this thing that they\\'ve made is clearly a really impressive\\nvideo generation AI tool that is both going to fool\\npeople and also be very useful. There\\'s also a watermark\\nin the bottom corner of every video generated by it. So if you see one of those videos and ideally it hasn\\'t been cropped out, then that\\'s at least a\\npretty clear indicator that it\\'s AI generated. It\\'s a Sora video. But also, I do think they\\'re\\ngonna have to be very careful with this, they\\'re gonna have\\na whole bunch of safety stuff to keep in mind. I think they\\'ll probably\\nhave to be even more safe than DALL.E. Like you shouldn\\'t be able to\\ngenerate people\\'s likenesses. Like you shouldn\\'t be\\nable to make a politician look like they\\'re doing\\nsomething on video, especially this year. You probably won\\'t be able to make Will Smith eating spaghetti, but it also definitely\\nmeans stock video generation is absolutely going to take a\\ndent out of video licensing. Like I can basically guarantee that. Like logistically, why would\\nanyone making something pay for footage of a house in the cliffs when they can generate one for free or for a small subscription price? Like that is the real scary\\npart of what this tool implies. But in the future, it gets\\npretty existential, man. I mean, okay, if this\\nis trained on all videos that have ever been made by humans, then surely it can\\'t be\\ninnovative or creative in ways that humans haven\\'t\\nalready been, right? I don\\'t know. Either way, I\\'ll have all the links below for all the Sora stuff, for OpenAI stuff, and I guess I\\'ll talk to you next year when we look back and go, \"Remember that first version of Sora \"and how bad those wolf pups looked \"when they spawned out of nowhere?\" Just remember, this is the\\nworst that this technology is going to be from here on out. Thanks for watching. Catch you the next one, peace.

      "[Document(page_content=\"this full stack web development course is designed to equip you with the skills to create a robust scalable Task Manager application from scratch the course integrates the dynamic duo of nextjs and react on the front end with Prisma as the omm for efficient database management using mongodb you'll gain a deep understanding of setting up your development environment designing apis managing databases and deploying a fully functional web application that efficiently handles real world tasks Wilson from the code dealer developed this course hello everyone in to this's video we're going to be creating a to-do list application that has sign up and sign in so here is the profile of the user that is currently signed in uh we can click the user and then we're going to be able to sign out or manage the account also we are going to implement a top loader here so when I navigate to the important tasks you're going to see there going to be a loader here okay and when I go to completed you're going to see the tasks that are completed and you also going to see the load as I navigate to other pages okay and uh so this is the main page we can uh create a new task I'm going to say hello world and then I'm just going to say hello world okay world and uh here I'm just going to set a random date and then uh we can toggle if the task is completed or it's important so I'm just going to make this important and complet it it's not going to be completed so when I click create task you're going to see there it is the newly created task is going to be at the top hello world we can togg or completed so when I click complete as you can see we have we have a toast that shows us the task has been updated we can you know update the task as well as as many times as you want uh we can also delete any of these tasks when I delete it's going to show us the task has been deleted all right and uh so when I go to the do it now page you're going to see the hello world is going to be there but when I click incomplete it's it's no longer here so it's completed as you can see now the Hello World Is Now Inc completed okay and uh this uh project is also uh responsive we can click I mean we can also add the task from this pattern here as well okay so to show you the project responsive I'm going to make the screen smaller so I am going to select for iPhone 12 Pro as you can see it looks even good on iPhone we can create task we can you know show the sidebar and hide the sidebar uh here's how it looks okay it's uh really responsive as you can see the sideb is going to be hidden on smaller screens okay we have multiple ways to create the tasks so we have a task and this button here so this pattern is always is always going to be at the top so when I make the screen even smaller as you can see it's always going to be at the top so when you scroll all the way down here you can still click and add a new task you can open and close the sidebar okay so that's it for the demonstration for this project so I just want to show you why I was away I was on holiday and the other thing I was also building my website so it's still under development so I'll just show you a quick demonstration so here's the homepage all right and uh we can toggle the light and dark mode okay and uh we have the courses page so it's loading and uh here's the only video I have at the moment because I'm still testing so you can you know kind of uh sign up for the if you want to see the video uh some resources so if you want to see more you have to sign in lessons you can click of these lessons you can watch it on YouTube you can view the source code and we can go to the blogs so this data is just random so I was just testing how it would look and style this page and this is how it's going to look like okay I'm still making the content for this website so maybe next year I should have a lot of content to put here uh let's say we want to um we want to watch this video so when I click it's going to take us to the signin page and then let's sign in so if by the way if you want to send me an email about anything just you know my email already um just go to the uh to the about section on YouTube you can see my email or you can see it when I send in there was my email there so now uh we can go to courses and I can click this video and uh oops we're going to be able to watch this video okay and uh there's going to be the description here we can also change the theme to a light theme we can open the sidebar here oh I need to fix this button here on on the light theme so it doesn't show nicely here so I'm just going to change this color here uh we can now now go back to the homepage we can go to the resources we can see resources we can filter uh these resources also the lessons we can filter if we have a lot of lessons uh I didn't put the filtering system on the blog section but I'm still developing this website uh I'll will let you know if there's more stuff that have that have been added but uh if you want to check it out just uh visit the Cod dealer.com and you can check it out for yourself okay so yeah uh I'll see you in the video all right so I'm going to start by creating a new project so go to the terminal make sure you're in the folder which you want your project to be in I'm going to run MPX and then create and then next app and then we're going to be using the latest version I'm just going to name this app my tasks you can name this whatever you want so you're going to be asked if you want to use uh typescript you can select yes one no it's up to you I'm going to be doing yes and then T1 CSS yes we're not going to be entirely using T1 CSS but we might want to use some utility classes from Tailwind so I'm just going to do yes and then no for the source directory and then yes for the up rter and then it's going to create the project for you just wait it's going to take a few seconds depending on how quick your internet is okay uh it should be done by now okay so once it's done you can CD into that folder or you can manually open the folder like this and then select that folder and then select now we're in the folder let's go to the terminal so in the terminal we can run mpm runev uh this should be in Local Host 3000 so this is the final project okay so um it should be Local Host 3000 okay it's taking time to compile I'm going to close this okay so let's go in the app directory in the page we're going to collapse the main first off let's see if it's working there it is there's the stter page I'm going to collapse the main and remove this okay and then there's an empty main let's go to the global CSS in the global I'm just going to get rid of everything except the Tailwind utilities okay so now it's empty so um let's see what can we start with let's start with uh the global okay so uh in here here I'm just going to set a background color and a font size and a color a def color of white in the body okay so body like this actually I think I will return back some Styles here uh I'll leave the root as it is and the media I'll just get rid of stuff in the body and then why do I have Auto completion okay here I'm going to do background color so this is the 188 188 okay black color and then the default color is going to be white okay so this is our nice background I'm going to give it a height of 100 VH okay that's for the body so let's start with the sidebar and then we do the main content so for the sidebar I'm going to create some components components components for styling it's up to you you can use SAS or you can use start components but I'm way I'm very used to start components npm it's up to you what what you use so uh styled components components okay so what we need to do now is just work on the sidebar okay so for the sidebar um let's create a oops a new folder in here it's going to be sidebar and then we're going to create another component it's going to be button okay so let's start with the sidebar let's say sa a sidebar here sidebar. TSX so this is going to be a client component so make sure you do use client at the top we're using next 13 use client okay so we should have a sidebar so uh we want to uh render the sidebar okay so where can we show this sidebar uh let's create a new folder let's name it um providers you can create it outside of this app directory that's fine but what is better to create in the app directory okay so let's go to the layout lay out in here above the children we're going to render the side Side Bar sidebar okay so we should have a sidebar right here okay sidebar so uh we need to display Flex the sideb and the main content so I'm just going to go to the page I'm just going to say main oops content wrong spelling content okay so there sideb content so we're want to display Flex so this is the sidebar and the content so to do that to display Flex we need to go to the layout so the sidebar and the children so we're going to put this in a wrapper okay so the rapper is going to be in the providers I'm just going to name it global Styles provider dot so the global sty provider you can it's a TSX file okay Global oops style provider. TSX like that so this is going to be use client as well it's a client component okay we're going to create a boiler PL like this uh we're going to create an interface interface let's name it props okay so it's going to be children in here it's going to be the react node so it's going to be our app which is going to be the children so here children and this is should be a fragment so make sure you destructure here children from props okay so we we're going to wrap our entire application with uh Global provider so if we go to the layout here we need to wrap this with the global style provider like that and then take this and WRA the children as well okay so whatever Styles we put in the global are going to be reflected in the entire application so here I'm going to say con global you can name it Global Styles oops Styles equal to styled and then dot div like that oops start div uh shift for some reason my escapee button is not working okay I'm using a gaming keyboard so it doesn't have this tempor R so I have to hold shift out and escape to do this so it wasn't working okay so you take this and put it here okay so make sure you import St from style components like this if you're using components okay so to see if this is working we can do background and then let's set to Red so as you can see now the background is set to Red that means it's working so uh in here what I'm going to do uh I'm just going to give it a padding padding padding top and bottom I'm just going to set that to 2.5 RAM and then I'm going to do display Flex display flex and then Gap I'm going to set the the Gap to 2.5 Ram as well and then I'm going to set the height to 100% let's save okay so there it is so now we just need to go back to the sidebar here we're going to do con sidebar sidebar styled we're going to style this sidebar equal to styled so for the sidebar uh this should be well I think this uh na okay we can do st. na style. na like that oops okay styn so make sure you import style from style components like that oops import styled from style components uh copy this and replace this wrapping div okay so uh what we're going to do now we need some variables for our colors so just in case we want to change this to light dark mode whatever color you want to change so what I'm going to do I'm going to introduce some variables okay so what I'm going to do for that I'm going to uh provide you with the file which has variables so some of these variables we're not using them so these are the variables I'm using for code dealer.com so this is my website I'm using so these variables here so I was a bit lazy to kind of so here we have light and dark mode okay so so these variables you're going to see here are the variables that are used here okay so now I am this website is still under development by the way so it might be a bit slow to your teste so we have lessons we have resources and stuff all right so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take those variables which I used in the project I'm going to create a new folder not not inside components but inside app I'm just going to name this context context I'm just going to put a copy a file here called themes so these are just variables for the colors we're not going to be using a lot of these variables okay so we're just going to be using a few okay so the ones we're not using you can remove them later on okay so here is just uh an object so we have a default this should be like a dark mode that's the default and then we have a light mode you can add as many themes as you want so this this just an array of objects that has color variables in there okay so we have name color whatever okay so now uh what we're going to do we're going to be creating a global context provider I'm just going to say Global I'm just going to you can name it Global context provider or just Global provider that's entirely up to you okay provider. JS okay so now in here it's going to be client component going to be a client so in the global uh we're going to create um context for the updating and the actual context okay so here we have importing the create context and use State okay uh we also need use context so we're going to be creating export con Global should be Global context is go to create context and then export cons global global update context just in case we want to update this context and then we're going to do export con Global provider uh the children we're going to wrap it's going to be our entire application so we're going to wrap with the global provider and then here we're just going to uh return okay I'm just going to get rid of this Global State uh okay so we have the update okay so we have the context provider uh the value here is not going to be the global State we're going to pass some Val values here later on so the first one we need is theme which is going to be the variables of our colors so that's the theme that's why I'm using theme but we haven't created the theme state yet so we need to create a state for the theme okay so I'm going to say con it's going to be selected theme so the selected Theme by default it's going to be zero one because arrays are zero um zero index based so if you remember our colors is an array of objects so zero is the first object and the variables within there so that's the first theme zero if you have another theme it's going to be one the second one is going to be one and so on okay so um so we have the selected theme set to zero and then I'm going to do con theme equal to themes we need to import themes and then select the theme so by default the theme is going to be the first so the themes this an uh an array themes it's an array and then the selection is going to be zero that's the the index here in the state and then we are putting that to the state which is selected theme which is zero if we shift that to one if we update the state it's going to be one it's going to be the next theme okay so we are sending that value here so for us to be able to use these values uh we need to go to the uh providers providers uh we need to create another one called context provider because the page the layout this is a server component provider so we cannot use the client client we can use uh the client like um States like use effect or use use state in here the component must have uh use client at the top for us to be able to use that okay so TSX context provider. TSX use client react functional component and Export we're going to do interface props oops interface props so here we're going to do children it's going to be react node and then here be the children so we need to do Global provider Global Pro provider and make sure you import Global provider and then wrap the children like that get rid of the div okay so like that so now we should be able to have access to the state but we haven't wrapped our entire application yet with this context provider so go to the layout and we need to wrap this with the context provider okay so uh I'm going to do context provider like that and then wrap perfect so how do we know if it's working well if you remember in the global provider we sending theme as a value so we need to get this value the theme okay so let's see what the theme this theme is so here when we have over it shows you what it has so let's go to the sidebar so for us to get theme um we need a way for us to get oops to get this theme okay so for us to get that theme we need to create two more functions okay not we need one function to get the theme but we need one function to update and one to get whatever values here we are sending okay and for the update updating as well so for us we need to export for us to be able to use the context export const we're going to be use Global state okay and then it's going to return um use context okay so it's a function returning use context and then we're going to be using the global context okay so now we're good to use the the values we are sending here but just in case we want to update we need to do the same thing for the global update and then we're going to be using the global update context okay so for us to be able to access these values we need to get them from from use Global State okay so what we need to do go back to the sidebar we can say con let's dist structure we need to get the theme okay equal to use global global uh use Global State I hate this auto completion is issu okay glob state it should be coming [Music] from let's do at app and then slash context Global provider okay so now let's C this uh uh what issue do we have here theme okay so let's go back the theme we're sending theme Here State let's go back to the sidebar and let's click this okay this is rather weird um okay I'm just trying to see why uh the theme is not working and find okay let's uh try this uh go back to sidebar let's do context context let's see what we have context okay so it's undefined so we must have done something wrong so let's go to the provider okay so yeah this is oops context provider it should it should be Global provider provider like that the one coming from the context not Glo I didn't notice I was using Global style provider okay so this should be Global provider like that so if we go back to the sidebar if I save uh say Global okay go back so here I'm just going to set as an empty object for now okay so now if I go back to the sidebar as you can see now we have an object which is the a property of theme at the moment but we are going to destructure this we are only want to get the theme and then let's see this in the console as you can see now we have those variables for the colors okay by the way I'm using uh I'm using it I'm using um an extension called console ninja so I don't need to go to the browser to check the console I can check I can see it from here without going in the browser okay so now let's uh Begin The Styling so for us to be able to access this uh the theme Styles not the Styles I mean the variables in the Styles so we're going to pass this as is a prop in here going to name it theme and then we pass the theme we're going to be able to access it here so uh what I'm going to do I'm going to start by giving it a width okay a width and a height so for the width for the width I am going to do props okay so I'm the props that we have so we have um props uh we oop we're going to do props do theme do sidebar width okay so this is the we have a variable called cyber WID okay uh let's check it out let's inspect the sidebar to see if it has the width okay as you can see now it has the width nice that's pretty good so uh Side by with uh what we're going to do now I'm going to give it a position of relative position relative and I am going to give it a background color background it's going to be prop props do theme uh so the color I'm going to give it is going to be color bg2 color bg2 okay so Props and then the prop we want is called theme and then the variable is color pg2 and then I'm going to give it a border so the border is going to be two P two pixels solid and then the color is going to be border color border color uh color number two I believe border color two that's the variable name and then I'm going to give it a border radius of one ram like that so there it is okay so um seems like inspect inspect okay so we want to display Flex these items so the nav and the main okay we want to display Flex that so now uh we need to go back to the global STS provider so that's where we need to do uh the display Flex okay actually we have a display Flex here Global Styles uh uh let me see why it would be working inspect H Global star provider uh let's go back to the layout okay so it's I don't know why it's not working okay uh open This Global Styles I have no idea why it's it's not working but it should uh have a flex let me inspect this so okay so like this it should yeah it should have a flex which is weird I don't know why it's not working okay let's leave it for now okay actually let's try to restart this project let's see why it's not working as intended okay so let's refresh okay I think I might know why this is an issue so let's go to the context provider uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a use effect okay so um going to go here I'm going to create a state I'm going to say is ready set is ready so here I am going to do react to use effect so I'm only going to display when the page okay so when the page is is uh you know fully loaded so I'm going to set a set timeout set time out uh after 200 milliseconds after 200 milliseconds and then I'm going to set is ready to True okay um if is not ready I'm just going to return now and then I'm going to save okay nice so now there it is for some reason there's a weird uh thing going on with the Border I don't know why let me inspect n oh it's border right it should be border if we go to the sidebar it should be just border not border right okay so now we have the border for the sidebar um let's just focus on the sidebar content uh I think I'll close everything for now if we need it we can open it later okay so for the sidebar I am going to start with let's start with the profile let's do profile so we have profile and then we have profile overlay overlay I'm going to explain where this T later and then we have an image so so make sure you import image from next image and then the width I'm going to set that to 70 and then height I will also set it to 70 okay so for the source I am going to just put an image in the public folder it's called Avatar one you can put whatever image you want so this is temporary uh when we connect with our click authentication we're going to be using that image so here I am just going to do Avatar Avatar 1.png I think it should show now it should okay there it is uh because this public folder is already been saved so we don't need to import like that we can just do it like this we don't don't need to include the public folder okay so we have the image uh let's make sure this image is in a container image all right so after that we are going to have an H1 and then we're going to name this um uh oops let's do a span actually span where is the calculator okay I'm just going to put a fake name so we have the name and the image okay after that uh we are going to do some na items we're going to do Ur n items feel free to use uh tail in CSS by the way feel free um I'm also going to create a new folder I'm just going to name it UTS inside the app UTS um I'm just going to add a file in here in the U it's called menu so here it's just uh the menu so we have the ID title icon and Link so uh we the first item here it's an array of objects the first item is going to be the homepage the second one is going to be the input important the third one is going to be the completed and then the fourth one is going to be do it now so the icon we need to import these icons so it's importing from icons so what I'm going to do is I'm going to paste another file here it's icons so some of these icons we're not going to be using them so we I'm going to delete this later on I'm just pasting the icons in here they're coming from font awesome what we need to do is get the font awesome CDN CDN uh what you can do F awesome CDN where's the CDN okay so copy this copy the link tag so uh what you can do is you can use react icons or you can use Font awesome it's up to you so go back to the layout here we're just going to do head and then I'll just p in the link of the CDN okay so change this to like this and then save so hopefully we should have some icons oops we're not looping the menu yet so what we need to do is Loop this map this okay so we go to the sidebar we that's where we're going to do the magic of mapping through so here we need to do menu we need to import that so we need to import menu at SL app then you toose and then menu like that so I think this a default export okay so like that so now we just need to map through this do map item okay so now we need to return let's just return a div but we're not returning a div we're going to return An Li okay so here we're going to return an all you can give it a class name of nav item if you want and then in here we're going to do item do icon and then we're going to import a link from next link and then it's going to be item. link not path we're going to go to the link and then here it's going to be icon item. title I believe like that so there it is nice pretty good so um what we need to do is when I click uh this lii I want to push to the link okay I'm going to say con handle and a click and a click okay so here I'm going to do router do push I'm going to say link I'm going to push to the link I'm going to say Link in here going be a string be router so we need to import router con router equal to use router from next navigation and then save handle click okay copy this function uh here on the AL we do on click oops let's do a class name first actually so for the class name I'm going to give it a na item so let's do a template literal oops uh templ Lal and then let's do na item okay after that we are going to do on click on click let's do a cic function and then here item. link so when you click it's going to Route the item. link perfect so I'm going to also uh get the path name okay so the path name name so when I click completed it's going to go to completed so I want to get the path name okay so to get the path name I'm going to say con path name equal to use path name the path name hook coming from next navigation okay like that so um I want to make sure this give this green active here so the the pathum that's active is going to have this green green color here on the side okay so when I click this it's going to be the active one when I click this it will be the active one and so forth okay so uh path name here I'm going to do like this I'm going to say path name if path name equal to path name equal to link okay it's instead of doing item. link I'm just going to do this Con uh link you go to item. link okay like that instead of so I can just do link here so if it it's equal to link the pth name goal to link I'm going to set that to active otherwise not an empty string okay so if it's like this to this link it's going to be active if I'm on this link it's going to be active Okay and the other one is going to be an empty string perfect so instead of item. Link here I'm just going to do Link Link let's make it shorter all right so I don't think okay so uh we just need to add the sign out button it's not functional but actually we're going to add it later we need to create a button component which we don't have yet so now let's style this let's go down to the Styles let's start with the items so this I'm going to put up here I'm going to do display Flex uh let's do Flex direction to column justy content space between like that all right so I'm just going to say button I'm just going to put in empty button there okay so it's not just to put a placeholder all right so I'm going to give it a color so the color here I'm going to do color I going to do color gray three gray number three and then I'm going to Target the profile so for the profile I'm going to say margin top and bottom actually not top and bottom everywhere 1.5 RAM and then I am going to do position relative and then I'm going to do a padding one ram top and bottom and then 0.8 left and right and then I'm going to do order radius I'm going to do one r with a radius and then I am going to do cursor I'm going to set that to pointer and then font weight I'm going to set that to 500 and then I'm going to give it a color so for the color I'm going to give it a color gray zero or you can give it a color white okay I think gr zero does the job fine okay I am going to do display flex and then align items align items to Center all right so now I'm going to save this all right so let me inspect so we have the profile overlay uh use a button okay so now we need to do the profile overlay okay so I after the here I'm going to do do profile overlay overlay I'm going to do position absolute position absolute I'm going to do top zero left zero and then with 100% height 100% I'm going to do a backdrop filter I'm going to do blur I'm going to give it a a blur oops BL I'm going to set that to 10 pixels and then I'm going to give it a z index and a background and the transition and the Border radius like that and then finally I'll give it an opacity of 0.2 and a border of two pixels so there it is so it's not that bright but it's there that's it's like the overlay okay so when we have a it's going to be more bright okay nice so after that I am going to Target the H1 within within the profile I'm going to give it a font size of 1.2 Ram like that uh I think I'll do display Flex Flex Direction column like that okay I think I think that does it uh reduce I think the line it is way way too much let me check here actually we're using different fonts so I'm going to change the font I leave it as is actually line height I'm going to do 0.04 oops uh 0 seven let's do two 1 0.9 I don't know just find what you like I say I don't know ah okay I'll leave it like that okay so I am going to Target the image and then I'm going to Target the H1 I'm going to set position relative and give them Z index of one okay so for the image I'm going Target the image again I'm going to say Flex shrink I'm going to do zero I'm going to set display inline block overflow to Hidden and I'm going to give it a transition of 0 5 seconds is like that nice all right so I'm still going to give it WID and height of 100% of um 70 pixels and the actual image with width and height it's already been set okay so nice it's looking pretty good so we just need to work on the H have effect okay so from let me collapse this profile overlay collapse so we have the image okay so I'm just collapsing this so I can see where I'm going with the Styles okay so what I'm going to do after the image I'm going to collapse I'm going to Target the direct H1 uh within the uh where are we still in the profile yep so I am going to clamp the font size okay so I'm just going to clamp the font size so depending on the screen size it's going to be smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller okay so I'm going to give it the margin left as well of one ram and line height of 100% like that okay I think I'll reduce this to 0.8 0.8 but in the original I'm using I'm using one ram so it's to you like that so that's good so now we need to do on H when we have this profile it should be end H so when we have the profile what time is it when we have the profile I want the profile overlay profile overlay I am going to give it opacity of one opacity one and then the Border I'm going to set it to border two pix two pixels and then a color of Border color too like that so when we have her as you can see now nice and the image remember we are we have set the parent of the image the Overflow to Hidden so the scale I'm going to do 1.1 when you have as you can see so the Overflow of the parent of the image is set to Hidden so the image is not going to overflow the container okay nice nice uh effect so now now we have that so we just need to style the items here so I'm going to be collapsing the profile for now and then we have enough items n items okay so for the na items um I'm going to give it a padding padding uh I'm just going to set it to 0 2.6 RAM and one ram top and bottom point 6 and then actually this should be enough item the Ali the list item like this all right uh I'm going to set the padding left to 2.1 2.1 Ram like that okay so you you can set this in one line if you want so top like this right like this bottom like this and then left 2.1 like that we save the line okay so I'm going to do a margin margin um I'm going to do 0.3 Ram and zero I'm going to do display grid display grid okay so the grid is going to be the icon and the text okay so grid template columns so the icon I wanted to occupy space of 40 pixels and then one5 for the text like that okay so what we also need to do is we're going to set the C to pointer cursor pointer uh we also need to set the position to relative all right position set to relative so um what we need to do now is do an after an after oops after so when it's active actually the after think is this when we have her you know it comes like this that's the after I think this is the before s element the green thingy okay so now um I'm going to set position absolute I'm going to oops position absolute I'm going to set the content with zero top left zero uh height 100% And Z index one and then I'll give it a bit of a transition okay like that so the width is zero when we have a the width is going to be 100% okay it's going to transition to 100% okay so that's that so uh we need to do the before Su element as well okay so some of the stars are quite as similar here but uh let's I'm just going to give it a different color so it's going to be color green dark so this one green dark so it should be okay so that's the before I'm going to give it a border top radius top left radius and and Border top um and Border bottom left radius 5 pixels like that so when we have that's where the that's when the magic is going to happen okay so um I think I'm just going to tag the anchor tag I'm just going to say the font weight to 500 uh okay so when we have this item when we have I am going to set the width of the after to 100% okay as you can see now it's uh looking pretty good it doesn't look it doesn't appear to be nicely centered we're going to fix this okay so after the hover I I think before the hover here instead of keep I'm not I'm not going to keep nesting here so after the anchor tag I'm just going to Target the I tag I'm going to display flex and center and give it a different color like that all right perfect so um now what we need to do again is I an here I think I'll just I give it a transition and the Z index okay like that so um after this I am going to Target the active n item I just TG the active so we have active so for the active I am going to set the background color to active nav link like that so that's the active and then I'm going to Target the it tag so the color I'm going to say that to color icons two like that okay so it looks looking pretty good all right so we haven't created the pages yet so and then the a tag so I'll just do like this and a tag okay so icons to like that perfect so uh the other thing that's left is the before Su element so I am going to do do active do active before like that and then the width is going to be 0.3.3 Ram like that so there it is okay so we have that I think um just targ the button just going to give it a margin I'm going to say 1.5 R all right so for some reason I feel like uh it's not nicely centered is it let me inspect this it's not like nicely sent it as I like it to active Okay align items Center it's not aligned okay it also depends with the font you're using so line height okay line height L ping top 0.6 the bottom should be 0 six as well 0.6 okay so yeah uh let's get rid of uh Lite in here let's set that to zero all right I mean uh let me inspect again line height oops not the active but the anle tag n item a line height zero align items Center uh align items to Center so the items should be centered but we need to fix so top 0.6 let's do 0 7 and bottom 0.7 as well like that so it should look pretty good okay you can increase this padding actually so bottom let's let me make it a bit bigger eight so this one should be nine nine like that so you can kind of I use your eyes to kind of see the balance all right so the reason why it's different because there's a button here so if there's more space here for the button it's going to look identical okay so that's pretty much it for the sidebar now we just need to uh build these pages that we want so we're going to have important important so it's going to be a page to TSX okay use client react functional component and Export this should be important I'm going to copy this so with important uh we need another page called completed so in next it this is how we do Pages as long as you put a folder in the app directory and have a page. TSX or page as inside it will be recognized as a page and the name of the folder will be the actual route of that page so we have the completed so this will be the route completed okay and then if as long as you have page TS TSX in here we are good to go and then this should be completed completed and then we have let me check what route is this oh I've disabled the routing so it should be incomplete incomplete incomplete like that and then we should have a page do TSX and then paste it and then we're going to have incomplete like that so when we go back we should be able to route to these Pages nice okay so the active you can put the color to white if you don't like this color the current one or you can put it to Green it's up to you what you decide to use all right so let's start with um the content we're not going to do the content we're just going to do this background here for that let's go to the layout so in the layout uh first of I'm just going to close everything layout okay so in the layout what we need to do um I'm going to set this with to 100% all right um I'm going to put a div here so the width I'm just going to say width I'm going to do class I'm going say width full so this utility coming from T and CSS so it basically means width 100% so the width is% right now like this with four okay so uh we need to kind of uh give it a background so here we're going to Target so the main that's what the background is okay I just copy this color here let me check again okay so the Overflow Alo okay so for this one uh we need to create a component which is called tasks okay so the tasks are going to have this background here okay so on each page we're going to render the tasks so we are going to go to components and we're going to create tasks tasks and then in there we're going to create tasks to TSX and then react functional component export and then in the H page we're going to render the tasks okay like that so the Tas tasks it's going to be dynamic later on so here we have the tasks uh we are going to say con oops not in here here but in the tasks H tasks styled equal to styled make sure you import style components and make sure this is a client component use client I'm going to copy the task style and I'm going to replace here and then I'm going to save all right so now we should have tasks here what we need to do is sty this so to start this I'm going to give it a width of 100% uh we need to get the theme which is our variables theme from equal to use Global state is This Global State yeah and then let's pass this as a prop so we can have access to it down here and I'm going to set the background background color to props and then it's going to be color bg2 and then I'm going to set a border two pixels border color number two and then I'm going to give it a border radius one ram and then a pading a pading of pading of two RAM and then I'm going to set overflow y overflow y to Auto you're going to see why we're setting to Automatic Auto and then I'm going to get rid of the scroll bar so I'm going to say this 0.5 frame the width okay so now there is our tasks tasks tasks okay so now now let me see height you can say that to let me set this with full wait a minute wait I to say the height all this should be here right anyways um task task task task task okay so by the way the height should it should just be full already I don't know why uh inspect ah I think I know why so if we go to page we just need to return the tasks like that so the tasks we can wrap it instead of a div we can make it a main like that all right so now we have the Tas tasks uh what we need now I'm just thinking what's next okay so now yeah what we need to do is do we can do authentication authentication so to the authentication uh we need to use click so I'm going to open a new terminal here so let's install click so let's see what click is Click so click uh it's a way for us to do authentication so to install click we need to copy this that's the first step and then we install clck so the next step is setting Environ environment variables okay so we need to create EnV do Loco in the root here do e NV local like that for some reason sometimes it gives me an error while I'm trying to install something I don't know I think it's a internet problem now it's working okay so now we have click uh we have to create um environment local and then the next step would be to create a provider it should be called clck provider or o provider you can name it whatever you want I'm just going to say o provider provider. TSX okay um so the next step is import and click like this and uh we need to wrap up with the click provider which is going to have like a click O Okay so uh let's start with actually to make it easier we don't need to uh create a separate file for this we can just do use this directly uh get rid of oops get rid of this let's go to the layout like that and then we just need to wrap our entire application with the CL provider okay so even the HTML should be wrapped all right I'm going to copy this and I'm also going to delete this terminal like that so we've wrapped with clck provider okay so now it's working uh let me see I don't know what's the issue uh if there's an issue I think we might also want to restart this project because we did not restart it npm runev all right and also I think the next step would be actually we need to create a middleware so we need here to create a file here called middleware TS like that so that's the next step and then let's just copy this this for pro uh Rod protection okay so let's save this save let's go back so now it's not going to work because we don't have a secret key in the in local so let's go to docs for click and then click dashboard make sure you create an account uh I have already an exist some projects already existing so create a new application add application I'm going to say my tasks like this uh you can click as many providers as you want I think the limited you have is three providers if you're using a free free tier in this case I am going to be using Google and email that's it I'm not going to use anything else so you can show more you can click whatever providers you want to use for signing in I'm going to create the application and then I'm going to copy the P the public key and the secret so I'm going to change this to don't use this and I'm going to P paste here for the secret key um let me check the name is should have okay so yeah it's already there so now we have the secret so it should it should send us to the login page okay so now when I refresh we're in the login page we're not going to be able to access to access the root page of our application so what we need to do now now we need so if we go to the middle you can see all the routes are protected so what we can do is we can set a a public uh public middle so public not public middle public route uh routes so if you want the homepage to be public you can set it to be public okay but in this case I want the hom page not to be public so this is fine I'm just going to get rid of these comments uh I'll get rid of the comments so the home page is protected okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to have a sign up page and a sign in so I want this to be in a signin page so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create those pages so I am going to create a signin signin page page. TSX oops react functional component and Export use client this should be sign in signin page oops I'm going to copy this I am going to create a new page it should be sign up sign up I am going to say page to TSX and then I'm going to say sign up page okay so the sign in um what I'm going to do I'm going to go to EnV local EnV loc you can put random stuff here it's fine uh EnV local I'm going to say next next Public public I'm going to do click and then sign in sign in url so the sign in url for this one is going to be what did you name it it's going to be sign in okay so it's going to be slash signin sign in like this that's going to be the sign in Euro so instead it's not it's not going to be using this random page it's going to have our own URL sign in url and then uh next public CL sign in Euro and then we have sign out sign up so this should shouldn't be sign out it should be sign up sign up so this should be sign up uh is this sign up yep sign up and then we have after sign up after sign in uh let's go to the homepage or you can just do slash like this and then we can do after sign out we can do to we can after sign out um oh after sign in and after sign up we can go to URL like that okay and then redirect public no no no I don't think we have a sign out do we after sign out I think we have a sign out so we're going to do login or sign in sign in sign in like that okay so let's save this so I'm going to go to Local Host 3000 so it should be sign in okay signing page sign in why is it showing the okay sign in page but it's not showing the form uh I don't know why it's not showing the form here the sign in sign in so uh I'm going going to go to layout I don't want to show this side bar uh do not want to show the sidebar okay so I'm going to do a condition I only want to show this sidebar when there's a user signed in okay so what I'm going to do I am going to get the user ID from out so this is a server component so we're able we're able to do this like con user ID equal to out out from uh click okay so we need to import out from click okay so like this oh like that so us ID so if we have user ID that's when we want to show the sidebar okay so the sidebar is not there for some reason uh did not see the form okay let's go to in local let's just check if the names are correct send in url uh make sure these URLs are correct this the environment uh environment environment variables are correct so I'm just double checking to see if they are correct URL okay let's save this let's refresh okay sign in page it's weird I don't know why it's not showing so for the secret uh get rid of this and then just put something random here like that so now let's try to refresh this restart the project since we've updated the EnV local okay so I'm going to go back to the Local Host 3,000 uh I don't know what's going on here okay okay I think I think I know why uh let's go back to the page so we have the sign in we need to import the component I forgot to do that so here we need to do sign in sign in from clck like this import the component the sign in component and save so we should have a sign in component here there it is okay uh we are going to be styling this later so leave this da for now because we're going to be using this for styling so we have the sign in uh when I do sign up we don't have this component we need this component as well so if we go sign up oops we need sign sign up like that save so we can switch between sign in and sign up sign in and sign up okay so now we need to sign up go sign up continue with Google and then I'm going to use my my email so if you have any questions you can email me for some reason my connection is really slow today so that's why it's taking forever to do anything that requires internet uh Let me refresh so slow okay so I just realized I had copied the wrong key so it was set to the code dealer so just change it to whatever application you're using in this case if you have only one application you don't need to change anything it should be probably be working by now so in this case I'm just going to change it to the correct application and then I'm just going to copy the correct key so as you can see the key is changing okay so I'll copy the correct one and then I'll just replace here and then just go to the sign up page I've already signed up uh with my Google account I'm just going to refresh this uh it should be able to work in a minute okay so I've already going to sign up and sign up with my Google account so you should be able to log to sign up don't go to sign in go to sign up to create an account first and then you're going to be able to log in like this okay after that you're going to be able to log in after you created your account so now here's the main page homepage so we need to start by creating uh we need to be able to create this tasks okay so to do that we are going to start with inst I'm just going to stop the project uh we're going to install a few things so we're going to run npm I at Prisma SL client I I'm pretty sure we've installed this in the beginning I can't remember but it's fine we can reinstall it and then we're going to also install um I think Prisma only Prisma with the client okay like that uh let's do at latest like that and then let's hit install so hopefully it should take only a few seconds okay that's that's that's it so if we go to the Prisma Prisma in it so we need to in initialize uh our data source which our database so we're going to be using Prisma and mongodb so the data is going to go to mongodb so we need to run Prisma in it uh okay we need the one that include a data source okay so copy this uh there should be init uh it's not here init it's taking ages to load data source anyways like this so you copy this Prisma in it initialize we're going to initialize the data source we're going to say that to mongodb not SQL and then just WR mongodb DB and it's going to generate it's going to generate a EnV file as well as a Prisma folder so in the Envy there's going to be the database URL don't change the url name what we're going to do is just going to mongodb mongodb so when you go to mongodb uh this is the wrong side mongodb okay it's taking AES load okay so go to sign in sign in sign in uh with your account and then go to database click connect copy the node URL copy that if you copy just paste it here and then put your password okay put your actual password and then after here you put your database name instead of my DB just put the name my tasks like this my tasks and then uh just put your url here and then it should work but now uh what I'm I'm going to do I'm just going to put my own URL off of this screen because it's my personal URL I I would want to change the password again after this so um I just pasted mine okay so I've pasted mine all right now so we have the in view file with the database URL so after we've initi initialized uh the data source to mongod DV uh the next Source uh the next step is to generate but only after we create a model so here we're going to create a model uh let's name it uh what should we name our model let's name it task task you can name it tasks whatever you want let's name it task okay or post so uh I think I just name it task and then we are going to have an ID it's going to be string string and then we're going to map this like that and then we have the title description and then we have date the date is also going to be a string okay okay so we have uh ID title date description and then we're going to have is completed it's going to be a Boolean false by default and then we're going to have is important so it's going to be also a bulling and default is going to be false as well okay and then we're going to have created it dat time and then updated it and then we're going to have the user ID which is going to be the ID of the currently signed in user okay uh it's going to be a string as well all right so that's it for this one we just need to run npx npx uh Prisma and then we're going to do generate like that okay nice so now let's go to MPX Prisma for Studio let's see what we have I'm going to close this okay so we have the task task model as you can see now we have all of the fields we don't have anything yet okay so we need to start by creating an API folder uh let's name it a it should be in the app it should be API and then we are going to have task H tasks we're going to create a route. TS in there all right so we're going to have a few functions in here so we're going to export U export async so the function we're going to have in here is going to be post let's start by post post first and then we're going to do request it's a request object not request but request like that and then I'm going to have a try catch and then here we're going to have CG we're just going to say error creating task like that and then we're going to return and new next response like that uh I don't know why I have let me check to see why okay so we should have an error in here oops error so for the error I'm just going to say error creating task all right and then I'm going to have a status okay next response all right so now uh we're going to see uh why we're getting the error it should be next response. Json actually next response. Json so let's save it all right so instead uh uh error creating task yep now uh we need to duplicate this so we are going to get error getting tasks getting tasks uh after get we need to put we can make some updates error updating updating task task and then we're finally going to have a delete error deleting deleting task all right so now creating updating okay so now we have the methods that we want so we have the post get put delete okay so let's start by creating some tasks okay so uh the only way we can create is if we logged in so I'm going to D structure we're going to get the user ID user ID from out that is coming from CL like that that's how we get the user ID so if we don't have the user ID if not user ID it's going to be unauthorized okay so we're just going to return we're going to return a next respon response so this it should be Json like that it should be unauthorized okay if so we're going to get uh the title we're going to title this description date okay so we have the date uh we have completed completed and we have important important title description date completed important okay and then we're going to do a wait we're going to do request tojson like that okay so uh let's do some validations you can do these validations one by one but I'm just going to do them in a single block so I'm going to do if if no title description or date I'm just going to say missing by the way it's remembering what I'm uh what I've done in the original project so missing required Fields okay like that so after that uh we need to do if if title do length is less than three length is less than three uh we're going to do title must be at Le three characters long okay and then finally we are going to create the task we're going to say task equal to await so for us to be able to create we are going to be using uh Prisma for us to put the the date in the database okay so what we need to do is we need to create a folder in the app let's name it U oh I've already created the folder okay so let's go to U we're going to create a new file it should be connect so this is what we're going to be using to connect to the database okay TS like that so we're going to import Prisma client so I'll show you the documentation input pleas client so here is how we do it so to set a new client so we're going to import Prisma client and then we're going to say let Prisma and then we're going to say that to Prisma client okay so uh now what we need to do is we're going to check if if process do EnV do node EnV equal to production we're going to say Prisma new client like this we're going to initialize a new new client else else we're going to say if not Global Prisma and then we're going to also initialize a new client we're going to set the global to the Prisma I'm going to set the pisma to the global okay now uh we have an issue uh let's see if it's not working we're going to fix it later by the way we're going to export default Prisma uh Let's ignore this the type checking here uh we can ignore here here you know so we shouldn't have warnings anymore so now we are going to import in the in the in the root we're going to import Prisma so const task equal to await Prisma it's remembering what I was doing in the original project await Prisma so we need to import the Prisma from Ms task. create so make sure it's Auto completing here when when I do uh Prisma when I imported Prisma when I do dots it should show task okay or whatever name you you give into your model okay so make sure you're importing here from import Prisma from mws if you export it as default you should import it like this or as a modu you can inut like this okay uh let's go ahead and create a new task okay so to create a new task we have everything that we need uh here we just have to do data so the data we're going to put in the title the description I'll get rid of the user okay uh I'll save so it should be uh completed important so what did we name those properties oh the code is is completed we say that completed and then we have is important we said that to important and then finally we have the user ID where we don't need to do like this user ID because they have the same name so we can just leave it like this like user ID so the user ID is coming from whatever current currently logged in user from the cler okay so we have that so now we just need to return and next response tojson the status doesn't matter here okay uh we can just do like this task like that okay so we have a way a method to create this task the task so now we need to put this to the test so we need to create some components for us to be able to to create this we need to create a front end component so for us I'm just going to uh go back to the app I'm just going to put a form for us to be able to create okay so um just thinking uh what component did I use okay so I'm just trying to think what component I've used H I'm just trying to think okay okay okay okay okay so I'm just going to create a new component I'm just going to say model models like that I might be able to create a dynamic model but I just okay I'll just create it in here create content content create content. TSX uh create content yep it should be use client a client component use client it's a functional component we're going to export and we're going to go to the page the main page instead of returning only the tasks I am going to return a fragment okay a react frag doent and then here I'm going to tasks T actually no we are going to go inside the tasks in here I am going to say create content like that so I'm going to render the component that we just created so I'm just going to stop the Prisma client from running um Prisma Studio not client so we're going to run mpm runev mpm run Dev so let's wait for it to load so while we're waiting I was thinking to do the inputs in the global state but I'll just do it here to make it easier for you and quicker than doing in the global state in the context so I'm just going to do con title just to make it easier set title so make sure you import use state from react so we have use State okay um use title and then we need the description we need the date we need the completed con completed completed and then we need the important important okay so all right I'm just doing this state in an easy way in an easy way to understand okay and uh we have the we have the state for all of our inputs okay so now we have the the tasks that's still showing I think we need to refresh the page right uh oh it's on [Music] 3,1 because the original project is running on 3,000 uh why is it asking me to sign in continue with Google all right so now I am in the application so so it says create content here so we need some inputs uh for us okay so we are going to create some inputs we are going to be making this as a form I guess let's make it a form okay and we're going to have I'm not sure if we can put H1 in the form uh create a task and then we are going to have input control input control it's a div and then we're going to have a label label it's going to go to the title and then it's going to be title that's the label and then we're going to have an input input and then this input is going to have a bunch of things so we're going to have a value the value ID let's set it to title and then it's going to give a value the title which is the state value and then type it's going to be text and then name it's going to be title and then on change uh change I am going to do a handle change handle change I don't have this function yet but the name of the uh the event it's going to be the title okay so handle change we're going to change the title we haven't set the handle change yet and I'm just going to do a placeholder placeholder uh I'm just going to paste in a generic quick Place holder in here all right so now we we have that type we don't need to type it's already here okay so now we have the input input control we just need to duplicate this a few more times uh duplicate so we going to have description for the other one okay so I'm just going to paste in so the description is going to be a text area so description it's going to be a text area instead of an input okay and then put the rows to four I'm just pasting it to speed this up and then we don't have this handle change function yet so make sure the name matches the state okay the state and we are also going to have a date so the the value is going to be date on change it's going to be handle change of the date both we set it to a string the type is going to be a date as well and finally uh we are going to have we're going to have an input control get rid of this and then completed we're going to set that to a string okay so here it's a Boolean completed for so we're going to set that to a string and then we're going to send that as a string okay completed so make sure the name uh it matches here okay so the name and the handle change matches and the state matches as well and the ID match make sure this three things match okay so this is a check box by the way we're going to be triggering true and false okay and finally we have the 14 we have the one for so instead of completed so this one should be important important like that okay so the only thing that's me missing is going to be the submit button okay dot submit ptn okay we're going to do button type submit next time type submit okay and then we're going to just say submit it doesn't matter if I'm using a span okay so now let's refresh this hand change is not there we don't have this function yet so let's go ahead and create the handle change function okay so I'm going to do const handle change so the handle change we're going to be it's going to be a little bit little bit Dynamic so name String and then we're going to also take the event I'm I'm just going to do a change event like that or you can do any okay uh this is be a bit messy I'll just do any okay so uh now uh we're going to run a switch okay so the first one is going to be we're going to switch switch name okay so based on the name we're going to you know dynamically do the input so we're going to do case title we're going to set the title to e. target. value and then we're going to break and then case description we're going to set description okay we're going to handle the change for the description we're going to get the it. target. value whatever we're typing in the input we're setting that to the description okay and uh we have date same thing for completed all right and same thing for important and default we're just going to break okay so what we're doing the name the name which is the the name we set here so the input is a name so the name is going to be this one okay so the name of the input is date so name if the name is date so name is date and also name make sure it matches here okay and then if the name is date we're going to get the input for the date if it's completed we're going to set completed like that so now we should be able to have handle change working but seem to be not working currently uh let's refresh uh nothing okay so the handle change doesn't seem to be working at the moment uh let's see why and a change okay so yeah we are using all of our state values all right let me try to let's try to see so okay so for some reason it's not showing in oh because the color is white okay it's working but uh the color is white okay so yeah it's working don't worry it's just the color is white set to white but it's working so what we need to do is a way to submit this so we we have a post method if you remember so for us to handle the requests we need to we're going to be using xos so we're going to do npm I xos all right so now we need to do con we're going to handle submit okay so for the handle submit we're going to do e do prevent default like that okay um this should be a form okay and on submit we should handle submit okay so when we submit we're going to run that function all right so now let's save so what we're going to do uh we're going to take the state values all of those values we're going to do const task all of the state values we're going to put them in an object and then we're going to send them title description date completed important okay so it's it's an object and then we're going to send that object we're going to do a try catch uh we're going to say cons r equal to await await exos post uh we need to make sure this is an async async okay it's going to be a API tasks okay uh make sure it should be API SL tasks or whatever name you've named yours tasks okay uh I'm going to say if uh response do data do error if we have an error we are going to do a toast we need to install react H toast react hot toast uh this one okay documentation uh copy this install go to the terminal we install react hot toast so we have toast we're going to do toast oops toast do error so make sure you import the toast okay here import toast from react hold toast okay we we're not going to be able to see anything yet because we need to kind of wrap our application with the toast provider okay uh what we can do uh let's go to the documentation we just need to import toaster like this and and we can go to the context we can edit in the context actually context provider uh we can like this and then we can do a toast uh here toaster like that so it should be able to work if you have any errors so uh let's go to the application create so now we can do an error here toast do error we can do something when wrong like that and then we have to conso the [Music] error okay so after this we are going to do uh if actually I will just do a success for now and we're going to do some conditions later okay so now we should be able to create a task let's see if we have any errors at all we're going to find out so I think let's try it I'm just going to put random data date I'm just going to put something random like that I'm going to submit okay it says task created successfully I don't know how I'm not sure about I'm not so sure about that but let's console the task if we create if we create something um let's CG task I'm just going to put some random data here submit again okay seems like we're creating a task and the user ID is being added as well so yeah we are we are indeed creating the tasks we're creating the task uh what we need to do now is fetch and display the task tasks so fing the tasks uh it's not that it's not that difficult to do okay so we just uh do a get request and then do and then display the task so we're going to mainly do that in our context and then we're going to display our tasks okay so I think for now I'll take a break and then I'm going to continue okay so now let's work on retrieving our tasks so now we can create the task tasks so we need to to retrieve the tasks go to the rout and we're going to go to the get get function here so we just going to do the standard we're going to get the user ID user ID coming from us and then here we're just going to check if we don't have the user ID we're going to retrieve the tasks uh linked to this specific user who signed in okay so we're going to say con tasks equal to tasks a wait Prisma do tasks task. find manyu so this is the task model so we need to find manyu where the user ID matches the current currently logged in user okay so we're just going to say where user ID okay so we're just going to get the logged in user okay so let's by the way let's run I'm just going to stop this go to the terminal let's run uh Prisma Studio to see if we have our data in the Prisma studio so I'm going to refresh okay as you can see our data that we created is there okay so now we just want to retrieve that data so here we can return uh these tasks okay so we're going to return next next response and then the tasks okay so we need to do a get uh on this endpoint here on the tasks endpoint so we're going to do that in the context because we want to access the data anywhere that we want to so I'm going to go to the where's the context context context yeah so let's go to the global I think we can do it in the global okay and um I'm going to create a few functions let's start with uh getting all of the tasks I'm going to say const all tasks tasks it's going to be an async function Okay so all tasks I'm going to also have a loading State here I'm going to say con is loading is loading okay so here I'm going to do a try catch and then I'm going to set loading to True here and then I'm going to say con uh result equal to await await exos but we're going to do do a get method so make sure you import exio we're going to do a get method so/ API and then tasks so let's make sure exos is imported like this okay and um so the result uh what we're going to do is we're going to create uh a state for the tasks okay uh we could have used um we could have used a different way to handle this data okay we could have used a use reducer or something okay and then we're going to say const uh let's do tasks tasks okay so it's going to be an empty array or in initial um here we're just going to put the data in the array so first off let's see what we have CG response to data let's run a use effect here so react react. use effect uh use effect like that and then on initial render we are going to run the O task function okay so we should be able to see something in the console uh I'm going to inspect okay and there it is so we have an array we're getting the items or you can you know if you're using console ninja you're going to be able to see this in here okay so we're getting the data uh we putting that data into this array um so now we just we're just going to update the state with the actual data okay and then we're just going to set the loading to false uh let's console this error and then we're going to do toast toast something went wrong like that an error all right so now um actually we don't need this now uh we are going to send this data in here not select the theme but in this case we want to send the tasks in here so we're going to have access to the tasks in here since it's in the context so now let's go to the uh tasks okay here so we have this create here I'm just going to get rid of this we're going to create a model for that okay so here we are going to start with the title so we're going to create an interface interface uh we're going to have a title title is going to be a string and then we're going to have tasks tasks I'm just going to do any for now okay so now uh we are going to display and H1 here and then it's going to be the title it's going to be the title No Time title because we didn't destructure here we need to destructure the properties and then we're going to display the title here okay so now we've displayed the title I'm just going to create a div I'm going to name this tasks tasks and then give it another class called grid as well okay like that and then we are going to get the tasks uh we're getting the theme Here we need to get the tasks as well like that uh why do we have an issue oh wait is it tasks so wait we need to give this a different name um we don't need to get it from here actually we're going to pass it somewhere else uh wherever we're entering this task component okay so here I am going to map the tasks tasks and then I'm going to return a task okay so in this case we're returning a div but I'm going to create I'm going to create a new component called task item task ask item. TSX it's going to be a client component use client react functional function uh we are going to go back here instead of returning a task div like this we're going to return a task task item okay so for this one I'm going to do task. ID like this okay so also here we can do I think we can do this and then we just spreading all of those properties okay we're just going to go to the task item uh we're going to do an interface okay interface uh task should be let me check well it's an object okay so here we're going to get these properties okay say it does not exist on type task task task uh let me double check task item task okay I don't know why it says that let me PR to any for now uh let's see uh in the task item we're going to show display this data so we have an H1 which is going to have a title and then P description and then we're going to have a date a date okay so this this statee is not going to be formatted uh tasks it's undefined because we did not pass the tasks in here so what we need to do is we're going to do con tasks tasks equal to use Global State and then we are going to pass the tasks in here all right uh is it Global state or Global context can't remember yes Global state so what's the issue okay so this should be a client component use client use client all right so the error should disappear now so now as you can see we have the task but we're going to format this date in a different way not like this okay so we do have the tasks uh let's go back to the task item task item um the date I'm going to give it a class of date class name date so let's see why we have an issue here uh okay I'm just going to leave it it any I'm I'm quite new to sub script so I don't know why it's complaining okay so now after the date we're going to go on the footer I'm just going to name this task footer task footer I'm going to have a button in here button and then it should have a class class name of completed completed and uh is should have te text of completed completed all right and what else so this should be is completed okay instead of doing this I'll just get the individual properties from here title string description date this should be is completed is completed okay uh we also need to get the ID which is going to be a string all right uh okay I'll get rid of this okay so I'm going to do a conditional here so I'm going to check if it's completed or not completed okay so it's a conditional Rend of this button here I'm going to cut this I'm going to say is completed okay if it's completed I will do this button else it's going to be incomplete [Music] uh be incomplete incom incomplete not incompleted so incomplete so we have completed and incomplete incomplete not incompleted incomplete like that okay so if it's completed it will show this otherwise it will show this okay um after the after that we are going to do a few more buttons so we are going to have uh Let's do let's do edit edit uh and then for the edit we're going to have an icon code edit make sure you import this icon from 's icons okay so we have edit edit so this should be a button instead of a div button edit and then we're going to have a delete uh but button delete and then we're going to have a delete icon delete I think it's called trash so we import the trash icon and then we save so we should have those icons okay uh for some reason the text is not showing let's refresh this I don't know why it's still not showing so description okay seems like we have an error somewhere so here I'm going to pass those properties uh pass those properties like that and then I'm going to save okay so now those properties are showing great great so now it's only a matter of styling let's start with um let's let's give it a title shall we so for for the title I'm just thinking what what title we should give this let's name it all tasks okay all tasks and then let's let's go ahead and style this all right so for the styling we are going to start with let's start with the H1 H1 I'm going to give it a font size uh wait oh I could have SW we had done the before element before the green thingy I think I've removed those tiles by by accident but any I'm just going to paste those tiles so here we're just going to uh copy this and then we've done we have done this H1 before by the way I've accidentally accidentally removed these tiles I think and then position to relative and then after is this green thing here I think I removed by accident okay and uh next tasks so next what we want um tasks uh okay tasks we need to do a grid okay but after after these tasks I am going to do a create task create task okay and then we're going to have a plus plus icon make sure you import the icon and then we're going to do add new task add new task like that so this should be a button like that and uh there it is add new task okay so what we're going to do now let's do the Styles uh let's start with so here we're just going to do a create task Styles we're going to do the other ones in the global so create task okay so the create task is going to be let me go to Local Host 3000 uh continue with Google so the so the task going to be this box here okay that's going to be for creating a new task so to create task I'm just going to give it a dis play flex and Center everything and then I am going to give the Gap Gap it should be something like 0.5 Ram oops 0.5 RAM and also I'm going to give it a height height I am going to set that to 16 Ram okay and the color and font weight and a border radius and also a border of three pixels all right so it should be something like uh like this okay uh I don't know yeah okay so sometimes it's taking a while to retrieve the user so this is the box like this okay so let's uh we've done the styles for that I'm just going to give it a h effect and H on H I'm going to set to gray five and the color to gray zero like that so let's see when we have like that but we need to give it a transition let's give it an ease transition 0.3 seconds should have like a nice transition all right so there it is we have a nice transition uh what we're going to do now is we're going to style the grid okay so the grid we're just going to put it in the global provider so Global Styles style provider I'm going to do dot grid so here I'm going to say display grid okay so I want the grid to be responsive I'm going to say grid template columns I'm going to do repeat and then I'm going to do Auto auto fail fail and then min max the minimum width is going to be 300 pixels and then it's going to automatically you know resize okay and I'm going to give it a gap gap of 1.5 Ram like that you can give it whatever Gap you want that's entirely up to you all right and uh yeah that's it for the grid uh we need to see what we also need to starty go back to the tasks uh we need to style the tasks tasks okay um let's start with uh tasks so let's let me check this one should have it's loading the tasks okay so the task item is what we need to style okay I need to give it this style here so uh we need to go to the task item and give it you know the Styles so task item con task item styled so make sure you import start components like that and then you are going to replace this I'm going to give it a padding a background color of color icons number two like that and then uh we are also going to give it a box Shadow a box Shadow like that and uh there's is okay so border set to border color two but color two seems to be wrong okay let me check to see why the Border color to is not working uh for now let's just do the styles height 16 RAM and then we're going to display flex and give it a gap okay so there's an a gap here okay so now we need let me check to see why what a color to I'm just trying to see if I this in my variables border color to okay it seems like I do have border color to but let me inspect see why it's not working okay so the background okay because we did not include we did not include the theme the theme prop okay so we don't have access to the colors const we're going to do theme I'm going to use Global State and then I'm going to pass it as a prop Here theme and let's save we should be able to see what we have okay uh the other thing that we need to do now I am going to let's go to all tasks let's give it margin top margin now let's do two R top and bottom and then zero left and right let's increase this to four wait tasks styled task styled okay so what we need to give this is should be the tasks so we need to select the class tasks like that uh in this case we're going to put it back to two okay or 2.53 I don't know that's entirely up to you okay so now uh we just need to give it a bit of spacing this one should go at the bottom here so what I'm going to do uh for the I think I will uh create I'm just trying to think how I could put it at the bottom task item okay H display let me inspect this it should have imine zero Auto somewhere okay so the date it is margin top to Auto okay so task item date date margin top to Auto so it's going to have leave spacing for you know in between here okay as you can see now we have the spacing okay so that's what we're looking for so we need to format this state like this instead of like this okay um so for us we're going to create a new utility utility function to format the date I'm going to say format date tojs Okay so we're just going to use this to format the date to whatever date that we want okay uh like what I showed you so that's how we have to format the date so I'm going to say export second we're just going to export default format date okay and then we're going to pass in the date we're going to format here okay uh for us to make this easy we're going to be using moment npm I moment so moment is a package that can be used to format dates okay so here we're just going to return moment and then we're just going to pass in the date we're going to format so we're going to do day month and year like this so that's how we're going to format the date and then we're just going to export default here export default for my date so uh let's go back to task item where we have the date here we just need to import format date format date and then we just pass in the date not as an object so we just need to import that uh it should be format date and it's exported as default okay so we should have the date formatted uh okay so here's the date it's formatted to our liking all right so now we just need to style these other stuff here so let's go back to the task item and style the rest of the items there so uh let's start with the H1 okay so we have the date let's do H1 H1 I'm going to give it a font size of 1.5 R and a font weight of 600 you can give it the color you want and then I'm going to select task footer here I'm just going to do display flex and Center align items to Center and give it a gap of 1.2 RAM and then I'm going to Target the button in there I'm just going to give it a border none and outline of none and set the curer to pointer and I am going to Target the icon icon I'm going to give it color gray too and the font size of 1.4 all right so let's refresh it's taking ages to load my internet connection is really slow okay so now we just need to display to set the edit actually to give it a margin uh left of Auto okay do edit margin left to Auto like that um so I'm going to Target the incomplete do completed and is it incomplete do incomplete incomplete I'm going to say display inline block and give the padding a back color and the Border radius okay so the other thing that I want to give it is going to be different colors okay so by default said to danger but want to change the completed to Green completed it should have color green back green dark like that okay so there's our tasks so we have in it's wrong spelling for incomplete so it should be incomplete incomplete like that and we need to also what do we need here okay I'm just trying to see okay we haven't added the sign up button yet we're going to add that later on okay so we have a caser to pointer so when I click here we want to toggle a model okay so first off I'm going to change this font to make to match whatever font I'm using here okay so the font I'm using there uh let me double check what the name of the font I'm using so it's called n nunito Nito I don't know how to pronounce it so here we are going to import it instead of enter it's just n like that and then Nito Nito okay so we have sub subsets it should be Latin as it is um we need the font weights so we're going to do weight so I'm just going to do all the way to 800 all the way up to 800 I don't know if it is 900 so let's leave it up to 800 like that make sure you put a comma and then subsets should be Latin yeah and then here instead of iner it should be Nito so that's going to be the font size not the font size I mean the font family okay so now as you can see it's using the correct font family so what we need to do now is um let's start with the sign out button sign up button so it's in the sidebar okay so sidebar I'm just going to close everything make sure it's clean components it's going to be in the Side Bar okay so here in button it should be a sign out button we're going to create a component for the button okay so button I'm going to do button. TSX it's a client component use client react functional component and Export so this button is going to have a lot of properties okay let's start with an icon icon is going to be optional it's going to be react. node react node and then we're going to have name name it's going to be also optional it's going to be string and then background background it's going to be optional I'm just going to paste in the rest of the the properties but so we have the selector and then we have the padding optional border radius optional font weight optional font size optional so everything here these are the properties that we so we have the double click okay we don't want the double click actually uh we are not going to use a blob are we so we don't want this blob here we don't want that the Border okay uh we don't want this property or this okay so I think these are the properties that we want here we don't this uh select a property as well okay so now I think we have the basic so the type we going have submit type of button or reset okay so here we're going to get the properties the structure why is it not Auto autoc completing okay uh we got the properties so now we are just going to utilize those properties first off I'm going to get the theme con theme Global State like that and then we're going to pass the theme Here theme equal to theme okay and uh let's do Style what is the issue here what's the issue I don't know what the issue is about and then we just set those properties to the Styles okay uh all right so now we just set those properties padding and then we're just setting to the padding so we can do a default padding here as well okay this a default padding if we don't set one a border radius we can give it a default border radius if we don't set one okay but uh I don't think I need a border radius by default actually we can have one so the font weight let's set it 500 by default font size uh we can leave it as it is border like that I think that would do it why do I have an issue here because there's no comma okay so we have default properties so here we're just going to get rid of this and then we are going to put in the if we have the icon only if we have the icon we're going to display the icon and then we're going to have name name span actually I was thinking to do a blob let me see if I did no I didn't do it here so this it's not necessary I'll save okay so what we need to do now uh let's do con button styled like that and then I'm going to copy like this uh make sure we import styled like that and then we save so we should uh wait where are we supposed to render the button again okay so in the sidebar here we are going to render the button okay so I'm trying to think uh because we're going to be importing a button as well from we're going to import it from um clar okay so I'm trying to think how I'm going to display but I'll just do this um sign out sign out and then it's going to have a position of relative okay and then I'm going to do button in here the component we created button like that and then we just need to pass those properties that we created so I'm just going to paste in those properties so we have the sign out the name uh select a button login I'm going to get rid of the selector and then we have the padding border radius font weight font size and then I'm going to pass in the icon prop icon equal to I'm going to do log out icon and then on click we don't have the sign out yet I'm going to save uh let's refresh we should have a button so there it is there's the sign out button okay so uh we are going to sty that all right I'm just trying to think okay M 1.5 R okay so okay we need to give it margin 1.5 frame so M margin bottom 1.5 FR how many is this yep mb6 so it should have mb6 for margin bottom 1.5 r like that mb6 okay so now we just need to go ahead and start this button okay uh I think we need to give it a left as well so we have um so we have a padding for this one so padding but imine so it should be everywhere so M6 then around it should be around so it should be M6 okay so now we just need to go and start this pattern so we go down here yeah let's start with the let's give a display Flex let's start with the position position relative we could we could use some St um some tail in CSS by the way position relative and then I'm going to give display flex and align Center and then I'm going to give it a color overflow of hidden actually we don't need the Overflow because we're not going to do some effects I was planning to do some half effects on the button uh there it is it's looking pretty good so far and then I'm going to Target the icon I'm going to give it margin right of one ram and then I'm going to give it a color of white or you can give it gray zero to I think I'll give it color gray zero to make it not that bright let's do gray three let's see what we have uh seems to be not working okay so the theme prop is included here I'm going to inspect to see why the color we 900 okay for some reason the color is not showing okay color gray three Oh wrong wrong spelling okay I think I'll also do the text uh did I do color here click okay so for the click we're going to do on click we're going to say that to click type uh we need to set the type to type okay uh we didn't do the color so let's do the color in here instead so color uh instead of color white let's do gray color gray to I think okay and uh when we have her we're going to let's do a transition transition let's do ease let's do in and out actually and then when we have a we're going to set that to gray zero uh man connection is like really weird for me all right as well as uh the icon so we want the icon to also change color okay so now we should try to we also need to do this transition in the icon itself uh let's do sign out sign out clck uh oh the sign out is here okay okay okay okay user button so in the user button that's where the sign out is so if I click here uh in the original here so the sign out is here so this one okay I can make it trigger this one okay we don't have a sign out method I'm not sure if we have one I think we do have one so we need to to import the sign out so sign out we need to import sign out from use click hook use click hook make sure you import the use click hook and then we need to do router con router equal to use router from next notification and then we're just going to push okay after we sign out uh one click on click here we are just going to go to the sidebar here click so the sign out we've imported in the wrong wrong component it should be in here it seems like we have route already use CL okay so now is it it just click okay so it's a cic function we have sign out like that but it's going to take in a cbic function okay router. push we just going to go sign in sign in like this so let's see if this works uh let's go ahead and sign out click okay so now we've signed out we can continue with Google and then it's going to lead us back to the homepage okay so now we can sign out uh what we need to do now we need to be able to you know toggle so when I click this create task we want to be able to toggle that okay so I think I'll take a break for now and then I'll be back on the next video when we are going to be working on the toggling of the model I'll see you in the next one okay welcome back so now I think uh let's start by implementing a loading bar at the top here so let me show you what I mean so if I go to my website if I click one of these links as you can see there's a top loader here a bar we're going to be using a package called react top loader so it's called react actually it's called next top loader like that so copy this command let's open a new terminal uh let's install Okay so that's what we need to do so let's go to the layout by the way so currently it only works with links okay so make sure whatever you're using to route with is a link um let's go to the layout so let's import the top loader next loader like this import next loader from nextjs top loader let's go above the context in the body here we're just going to say next top loader like that and then we're just going to put a few properties so the properties the first one I'm just going to give it a height I'm just going to say that to two pixels uh the next thing that we want is going to be color color let's say that to Red for status red um the other thing that we need is an using functionality so we're going to be using a cubic cuic Basia I don't know how to pronounce this is it Bia or Basia I don't know how to pronounce it beier I don't know I think it's French uh but now we're going to go and put some properties uh this one should be zero okay and this one should be one you can kind of generate this there's a generator for this properties it's called cubic B here if you go here you can kind of generate you know these properties and then you can copy whatever properties you want you can simulate see what it looks like so now let's see if it's working so now as you can see when I click the link it's working okay but I'm just going to change this color here uh I am going to go to the themes and I'll I'll copy the green dark I'll just copy the hex value and then I I'll paste uh I guess it didn't work I'll copy this green and paste so we should have a nice green color by the way if you want to get rid of this loading spinner here you can so you can just say spinner short spinner you can just turn that to false okay and then you have to refresh the page okay so now we have that uh the loading uh let's move to the next chapter so uh let me see okay uh for now we want to fetch this data when we have the user so sometimes there might be an issue so let's go to the context so if we have the user I'm going to say if user and and then we're going to fetch this the tasks so let's just get the user oh like this so con user like this Con to user and then use user coming from uh clck next next JS okay then we're going to fet the data when we have the user okay but nothing happens it doesn't update so once we have the user we want to reender this so we're just going to rerender based on the user like that so refresh okay perfect so now it works all right so now we need to do loading let's do CSS loaders Spinners okay I think I I'll just take any of this Spinners I'll take this all right uh copy and go to the global I'll just paste those tiles in and then uh we just need to create a span with a class of loader so let's go to the context provider context provider here we're just going to return a div and then let's put a span class name loader like that okay so if you see a loading here so here uh let's do a class name let's give with width four and height four and then we're going to do Flex item Center and then justify Center okay so it's basically Flex centering it here okay for the color uh you can give it that green color if you want to um if you go to the themes uh oops we need to go to the themes I think I'll give it this grade in color here can't remember which gradient it is so oh it's oh it's a border we cannot do a gradient on a border uh let's primary green green let's take the light one to see how it looks like all right so now let's refresh this oh I think we need did I copy the wrong one color green light I don't know why the green light looks white okay so okay so I think this will do um when it's loading we also want to do it for this one we're just going to do that later but for now I think what we need to do is delete the task and edit so let's start by delete here I'm just going to create a dynamic route okay so to delete we're going to delete based on ID okay and then inside the ID we're going to create route. TS and then export it's going to be async and then it's going to be function delete delete uh let's just copy a boiler plate here delete okay so we're going to do response should be a request actually no response request all right so we're going to do a try catch try catch like that that and then we're going to do a cogg and return we're just going to return next response we need to import next response like that all right so for us to delete we need the user ID and we also need to get the ID from uh from the params okay so uh what we're going to do in here we're going to get the params params and then we're going to get the ID like that params and then we're going to distract and get the ID okay so we are going to say const user ID so make sure we import the all the out and then we're going to get D structure the ID from params okay like that so uh we just going to check if we don't have the ID and then we're not going to be authorized to delete anything okay so we're going to delete a task B on the ID so we're going to say cons task equal to uh we need to import the Prisma from the connect from the U from the U here connect find unique so this is actually not find unique so do task dot uh should be delete delete where the user ID okay where ID is equals to whatever ID ID we are sending through the from the uh client okay so we're going to delete whatever ID matches this one what id was sending from the client so I'm going to show you what it looks like uh we're going to get rid of these console logs by the way later on so this is just for debugging to see how things are working and then we're just going to return so uh now what we need to do is we need to we need to um send the ID okay from the client so let's work on the delete so for the delete uh let's go to the global I'm want to say const uh delete task equal to async async so it's going to take in the ID okay going taking the ID so here we're going to do try catch try catch and then we are going to say CG error and then we are going to uh do toast toast. error something went wrong okay so we're going to do con response equal to exos ex. delete and then tasks and then ID okay so the ID we're going to pass in here we're going to delete that item all right and then uh we are going to say toast do success task deleted when we delete the task so after that I am I'm just going to refresh all tasks okay after we delete we're going to get the update refresh the tasks so we have to send the function here delete T by the way we need to also send is loading because we need to do the loading state so uh let's go to all tasks uh the component all tasks all tasks okay all tasks or tasks okay so for loading GED okay let's get the loading here is loading is loading let's create a component for it loading actually doesn't matter uh we just need add that class name okay so if if is not loading not loading so if it's not loading we are going to uh uh do this else like that okay so okay so it should have loading there as you can see loading okay but for this loading uh is loading let me say let con is loading equal to True okay so I'm just going to get rid of this for now is loading equal to true so it should be loading here let's tell this plus tasks loader okay so span uh I can't remember the name it should be loader like that so it should spin here uh we need to Center this let's do can I think withd four uh Flex item Center justify Center okay uh height all right I think we can put it the center here I think it makes sense or you can do it individually I don't know it's up to you I think I'll just do one loader like this okay and and uh I think that's it I'll just put the proper I put here like that and then get rid of this okay and we should have like a loader for a split second here you can put like a skeleton loader as so it's up to you okay nice so you can get rid of the main loader if you want to but uh that's up to you now uh now that we have the loader let's work on the delete so we need to go to the task item task item and then we need to do a me function for delete okay so for that we are going to delete one click we're going to run a quic function okay so for delete now we're just going to get the delete task is that what we've named it yep delete task like that and then we just need to pass in the ID of the task that we want to delete all right and uh uh delete task and then we pass in the ID which we already have here okay so hopefully when I click this it should delete nothing happened seems okay it did delete but there's an issue fetching the data okay uh let's create create content let's create more items shall we submit okay submit submit submit submit submit submit okay so we should have a lot of items Let me refresh okay so there it is I'll get rid of this create so let me try to delete this oops delete delete delete Okay so it's working but I don't want this blinking effect let me see if there's a way around it let's try to let's get rid of the loader actually let's just leave the main one okay let's get rid of this loader okay so it should work like this but it's taking a bit of time there's a delay when you delete so it's up to you if you want to you can put a loader yeah there's a delay uh we need to fix that we'll fix that uh in the coming section okay so yeah we can delete now we can delete so we need to work on [Music] the editing which is the put method we did for some reason I need to click twice to delete so let me double check the function task item onclick why do I need to click twice so click nothing happens click again something happens okay I don't know why I need to click twice um but I'm going to fix that later on yeah we we have an error as well here so we'll fix it later now let's just work on the editing so when I click complete I want to toggle incomplete as well okay and uh I think I'll do that in the next video okay so I just realized when we were deleting we had to click twice for us to delete the item um I was missing and await because I using async so it doesn't give you a warning unfortunately so we have to make sure we do await like that that's why we're getting record does not exist because we click twice okay so now let's save so now let's click now it's deleting we don't need to click twice anymore and also the pop up uh the toast is not showing okay uh we had a wrong input may I had the wrong input not you but I had the wrong one so it should be just react hot toast like this then save so when I click it should be able to show the toast okay so the next step uh I think let me go to the all tasks I'm just going to Cog all of the tasks responds to data let's inspect to see what we have I'm going to refresh okay so we have four items uh all of them should be completed I guess okay so we need to get we need to create some items which are not completed okay but these some of these that are completed it doesn't show it's completed I think we might have made an error somewhere so let's go to task item uh it's completed so it's completed it should show this completed button so I don't know where we have made an error let's go to tasks oh yeah here so it should be task is completed is completed like this so it should be green now okay so now this is the completed task we need to show the uncom the incomplete tasks so first off let's just create more content which is not completed not complete completed one some random date uh let's just submit random submit submit submit okay so now we should have decent amount of data to work with uh let's refresh or we're going to refresh by the way when we are we're going to refresh when we are uh creating a task when we when we're creating a model so we're not doing that yet so now we need to display uh the completed the to-do and the important tasks so what we need to do is create those pages we have those pages already but we just need to display the data okay so for that uh let's start with the completed so this is easy by the way to do the completed tasks so for completed uh we are just going to do a filter con uh completed tasks equal to we're going to say tasks do filter and then we are going to get a task and then we're going to return task that is completed is completed okay so the tasks that are completed uh that have been completed task do completed equal to True okay so this should be completed tasks completed tasks okay when the complet equal to true and then uh we should have an array containing completed tasks okay uh there it is four we have four items here so this is the array it is completed tasks which is equal to true so I'm just going to pass that into our stage complet the tasks I'll get rid of the console as well as this console here I'll get rid of it so we have the completed page where is the complete incomplete okay so this is the page for the completed it's going to be easy so we just need to say const we are going to get completed tasks okay from the State Global context and then here we are just going to return the tasks component tasks and then we just pass uh the tasks okay like this the title we setting that to completed tasks and then the tasks is the completed tasks so when I visit the page completed hopefully we should be able to see completed task like this okay so now we have the completed tasks we have all tasks completed and now we need to do the important so we're doing the same thing as well for the important we're just basically filtering the task to get the important okay so con important important tasks uh we're going to filter and then we're going to return where important is set to True okay so and also uh so we have import completed important we also want incomplete tasks okay so con incomplete incomplete tasks uh we just going to return uh it's completed equal to false okay so I'm just going to send those values here important and incomplete tasks tasks okay so important just go to the important page we're just going to do the same drill here so con we are going to get uh this is the important important tasks from the global State all right so we are going to get the component the task component and then we just put important task like this so we should be able to have the page now so if go to important uh it seems like there's an issue with the important let's go to the global so is important equal to True uh let me c this let me console log to see what's the important is showing important tasks uh let's go to the console and see the result so important tasks we do have an array here for the important uh what's the property though okay so is important okay is important is important okay we do have the items I do not know why we have an issue okay so now it seems to be showing now all tasks important completed okay don't worry about this one we need to give a key so we are okay so which component do I not have a key on let's go to the tasks so we have a key here I don't know uh let me find map map to see where I didn't put a key okay here we didn't put a key so we need to make sure we put a key here key we can just put anything anything that is unique so let's put item title or ID if we do have one we do have an ID so we put the key hopefully that error should go away uh I do not know why it's still there okay it's gone now so now we can navigate to this pages so the only page that is left is the incomplete page uh let me go to the global I'm going to copy the incomplete incomplete we are just going to do the same thing destructuring from the global State context and uh we are going to render the tasks tasks component and then this is what we have save so we should this should be yep incomplete important okay so this is completed the important tasks all the tasks do it now all right so I think one of the issue actually we're going to fix that issue later on the item that I click I create first I want it to be at the bottom the latest item I wanted to be at the beginning so we need to do some sorting of the items we're going do that when we uh create our model uh but I think that's pretty much it for the pages so now we need to sort out this button here when we click okay so we want to be able to show the user button okay so uh we're going to do a bit of a hack let me close everything here uh sidebar so we're just going to go for the sidebar we're going to do a bit of a hack to do this sidebar styled okay so so we have the profile overlay I want to add a user button after this image do user I'm going to say BTN okay so this user button I am going to import user button user button from clier all right so it should be imported by now so yeah use a button and let's see so when I click we're going to be able to see your account and you can sign out you can change your AV okay so uh what are we going to do for the user button we are going to set position to Absolute absolute and then Z index I'm going set that to 20 z20 and then top I'm going set that to Z zero and then width I want to say that to four 100% And then height height I'm going to say that to four as well all right uh so when I inspect you should be able to see this pattern here okay so we need to style this pattern more in the Styles so because we're going to do more more Styles okay so now let's uh scroll down for and then we have to find somewhere to style it all right so I'm just thinking um the image I'm just looking at the reference how I did the image okay so let me inspect here so the class name okay so yeah the one that we want we need to select this CL CL root box okay so in the profile uh I am going to select C to let's make it sure it's us a button like this just to encapsulate this in the user button now let's take it out of the profile and and put it separately like this so to make it cleaner so use a button and then we target the root box and then we're going to set the width 100% height 100% so it should be covering uh root box okay so as you can see it's covering the entire width and height all right so and then I'm going to Target the user button box oops copy this class name CL user button box don't copy the Lo locked class copy the ones which are not locked uh and then we go down then we're going to give width and height 100% as well okay and then I'm going to Target the button trigger button trigger and then I'm going to set the width 100% height and then opacity I'm going to set that to zero okay opacity to zero so as you can see it's not there anymore but when I click it shows okay when I click it shows the profile all right it nicely so it's like invisible but when I click it shows it shows the information about the profile okay you can manage this account you can sign out you can delete the account it's up to you okay so the it's invisible as you can see now but we want to get rid of uh I'm not sure if there's an outline but we can get rid of the outline if there is one but I don't see it so if you see it you can just get rid of the outline on active however but I don't see the outline now uh what I want to do I want to do the image okay to make it Dynamic so what I'm going to do now uh image I'm going to get the image from the user from the user object so we're going to con const user go to use user use user object and then we're going to get the user all right so what we're going to do is we're going to destructure for some let's see what the user object is again so I think we've done this before but let's see let's go console so there's the object the user here there it is uh it has some properties uh that we want so we can destructure this here so this is the user so it has the properties that we want so we want the name we want first name and last name and also the image URL okay so let's get those properties so we're going to say cons uh first name last name equal to user like that all right and uh uh what we can do like that and we also need the image URL image URL like that we need that property and it's going to be an empty string if we don't have it and uh yeah we just need to put those properties so instead of doing this uh we're just going to put the image URL like that okay so uh there's an issue here we need to set uh in the config where's the config next config next config okay so in in the next config we need to set where our images are coming from we need to put the link so next config images the domain so we want to set the domains for our images domains we're going to do Local Host and then we are going to do uh output clck this one okay and then uh I'm going to save all right so let's refresh this okay I think we need to refresh this restart the project okay so restart the project mpm randev and uh you just need to reload uh actually uh you should uh okay so it should be working now it's on 3,000 now it's no longer on 3,001 it's taking a while to compile but okay let's do something else while it's compiling uh the other thing that we want is the name so the name as you can see the name is still not the correct name that we want so for that we're going that's why we've extracted your first and last name of the user okay so here I'm going to get rid of this I am going to do first name first name and last name okay uh first name and last name actually it's going to be there first name last name like that and then uh seems like we've been signed out okay let's continue with Google because we are on a new New Port uh inv valid source prop okay so host name this one copy this go to the next config and put this in the domain and let's save all right so now so we have first and last name uh we need to capitalize this so class name capitalize so this will be coming from T and CSS by the way so capitalize so we want the first character of the first name to be capitalized and then the first character of last name to be also capitalized so now let's refresh this it's taking this time to compare all right so now the image is there now okay so that's the that's what we're looking for but but what I'm going to do I am going to change this image you can change you can do manage account and then you can you know change the image if you want to so here and do upload image you can drag the file so what I'm going to do I'm just going to open my public folder and then I'm going to drag that Avatar continue and then now we should have the image we can click and then we can sign out from here we can manage the account we can also sign out from here so the only thing that is left now is to click here and create a new task or we can also add a button here to create a new task up here you're going to see how we can do that later on but for now that's pretty much it we just need to uh work on creating a task okay so now let's start by updating this completed okay so what we're going to do let's open up this route so we had a put method there it is so here we are going to update only one uh one field so uh we let's get the ID the ID of the send in user from out and and the other thing that we want is the property that we want to change so in this case it's going to be the is completed it's going to be the only property that we're going to be changing we also need the ID of the item we're changing the property okay and then we're just going to await uh request to adjacent like that so now uh let's just check if we don't have the user and then we're going to return unauthorized like that and the other thing that we want is uh this should be in the try is the wrong place in the try like that and after that uh let's create a task that we want to update await Prisma task. update and then uh here we just update that task okay so in here we just going to say where ID that's the task we're going to update and then it's completed it's completed uh we just setting that to this property here okay so it's completed property we set it to that property like that okay uh or we can just do this like this okay because it's the same name all right so uh we are updating an item with this ID we're updating the is completed property with whatever property that is that we're sending from the front end all right and then now we're just going to return now we don't need the console by the way we just return the response okay so let's save and uh that's our method for updating so I'm that's pretty much it uh why do I have a delete here okay get rid of this okay so here we have uh put get and post so here we have the delete in the ID we could have done the the editing in this here but it's fine we can do here so now what we need to do is send whatever so when we click here we want to update this item here so let's go to task item so in the task item that's where we want to you know do the function for that okay so actually let's do it in the global global provider and then we do the function and then we get it through through our state so wait a minute so all tasks I'm going to collapse this collapse and then here I'm going to say const update task so here we're going to to send in the ID as well as the property of the task that we want to update in the in this case I'll just do an object here so I'll just do task so this task will be just an object which contains the ID and it also contains the property that Properties or property that we want to change and then we're going to do try catch and then we're going to do const rest equal to await and then it's going to be AOS put but this is the wrong endp point so we're just going to go into tasks API SL tasks and then task okay so now uh let's do a success we need to also call refresh the data here and also let's do a toast not root but toast toast do success task updated like this and then we re fetch the data and then here we are just going to C the error and show an error something went wrong when updating the task okay and uh that's it for update so now we just need to send in the data from so we need to send in the data from the task item so when we click the task item we just need to send in that data all right so uh task item okay so here we are we are doing on click and then we're going to do a cc function okay so now we do have a cc function so we also want to change the status um of this clicked okay so here when we updating what properties do do we want to update so we're sending in object and then in the back end we are getting that property all right so in this case we're going to do const task it's going to be an object so what we mainly need for in this object is the task ID as well as the is completed okay so here I'm going to do ID and then is completed okay and then we are going to set it to not whatever the opposite of whatever it was okay and then we're going to call the update uh update update task like this but we need to get that from here up Date Update task like this and then let's save so hopefully we are going to be able to update the task so let's try to click this we have an error so update task is not a function update task okay so it depends what button we click so we click the completed so this is completed uh uh it's okay so let's copy this and also put it here and the incomplete okay so the incomplete is basically the same thing here so let's save and let's click this okay we still have an issue update task is not a function so let's go back update task okay so let's C here update and also make sure the spelling is correct when you're importing and make sure you save also the file as okay update that was the wrong spelling up task so click okay as you can see it's changing now okay so it's working as expected so now what we want is to create a task so for that we are going to create a model so in This Global uh I'm going to create a model you can if you want to make this model Dynamic you can sort of con I want to do open model so you can put a key here to check to see what what key it is okay so I'm going to say const model model and then set model like that and then we have a key so we can put a key like if the model is equal to this key and then you know we can open that model and stuffff depending on what model okay so if if if like this right we can be like if model if model equal to whatever key and then you know we can do open the model okay uh in this case I'm just going to have this property without a key so set model equal to true and then close model equal to false so this is going to affect all of the models but you can add a key here if you don't want to affect all of the models we have but we're not going to have multiple models so that's why I'm doing it here it's fine and then we're going to have model open close Okay so uh this is the state of the model so currently it's false initially when you click we're going to set it to true when you click this function here and then false when you close the model so now remember with have the model uh in the models oops we have the models so this create we want to kind of show this when we uh click when we click this button here in the tasks so if you go to tasks so there should be create task okay so we want to go to tasks and then we have create tasks here we're going to do onclick and then we're just going to do open model like that and then make sure you get it from the State Global State and then save okay so when you click it's going to open the model okay so now uh let's style this model uh I'm going to close the rout we just need to style the model for now okay so actually I'll create the model the actual model first model TSX it's a functional component use client it's a client component not functional it's going to be a functional functional export here should be model okay so we have a functional component here so what we need to do now in this model is just we need like an overlay so I'm going to say dot model overlay like that all right and then when we click this overlay on click we're going to close we're going to close the model so here we need to get that uh con we need close model like this from Global State all right and um we need to get rid of the consoles by the way now we have this we need to put the content the content of the model so the model is going to be dynamic okay so we're going to create an interface here interface props and then content should be content should be react. node like that and uh we destructure here and then we have the content okay so whenever we render the model we're going to put the content here so uh let's try to render this model so let's go to tasks and then here we're going to to render the model so if model equal to true so we're saying model equal to true and then we're going to render the model uh model so this the spelling is incorrect uh but the comp the content that we want is the create content okay so hopefully when I click this as you can see now it's showing the content the content for creating okay but we cannot close this as well because we have installed this now let me rename this model it should be model all right so that should do it uh yes okay so now uh let's uh start by styling uh what should we start with let's start with the model itself so model con model styled equal to style. div so make sure you import styled from startled components you copy this place model style like that so now what we need to do I'm just going to set position fixed because it's going to be always at the top position fixed and then uh top zero left zero with um I'm going to give it 100% height I'm going to give it 100 VH and then a z index and then I'm going to to do display flex and then I'm going to Center everything justify content and align items to Center okay so it's going to be at the center like that uh we have an issue because uh tasks models model where is the issue with the input okay now it's working so there it is okay so now we need to style we need to style uh the model overlay model overlay okay so for the overlay I'm just going to give it a a dark background color and a position of absolute width and height to 100% okay like that so refresh okay so when I click it opens the overlay but this the content we want it to be uh on top okay so we need to give it uh we need to give it a z index that is higher okay so I'm going to select model content OKAY model content and then I'm going to give it a padding Z index and the with you can set this to Max width Max WID and then withth you set to 100% like that and I when I click nothing happens yet but because we don't have this class here okay so what I'm going to do I'll copy this oops copy and then I'll do like that content and then you we paste so when I click there it is okay nice uh let's keep going with the Styles uh let's go to [Music] the um to the task wait tasks okay to the create content actually let's St this so in the create content we want to style that so we should have const create content styled so this should be a form it's a form so make sure you import styled from start components copy replace place so now we're just going to style this uh let's start with the background so let's get the theme okay so Hand submit we need the theme con theme equal to use Pro State and then we pass that as a prop see here is a prop okay and then we're going to have access to that in the Styles all right now let's start with the H1 I'm going to front size I'm going to clamp okay uh one ram I think I'll do one ram the maximum is going to be one 1.6 and then I'll do actually let's do one 1.2 like that all right and uh F weight I'm going to set that to 600 600 and then I am going to give this a box Shadow a background color and the Border radius okay so let's refresh so we do have a box here ER okay so uh now what we want is to targ the input control input input control I'm just going to set position to relative and the font weight then I'm going to tag the input uh text area text area I'm going to give width of 100% and give no border border of none and then I'm going to say resize To None to none and I'm going to give it a background color and the color like that so let's see so there it is but we haven't actually set the background color for this whole thing but let's keep going uh actually what I would do I'll copy this let's go to the global CSS uh text area button let's said border border To None outline To None like that I think this will do it okay so yeah we don't have any more outlines and both orders anymore okay so now let's continue with the Styles uh okay so now I am going to Target the label okay so so we have the label we should probably start with a label uh for the label I'm going to give it margin bottom and a font size we're just going to clamp that and then I'll Tar this pan within and then I'm going to give it a color of gray number three okay so let's save all right so looks pretty good so the thing that we want to do for now is Set uh we need to set the background color okay so I'm just just wondering like uh where we could uh set the background color but I think we should set it uh in the model content which which uh model content what is the model content model we need to import theme theme okay so make sure we import theme from Global State like that and then we pass it as a prop so we shouldn't have that issue uh let's inspect to see why it's not why it's not showing the background color Okay so oops get rid of the mobile view model content okay so model content doesn't show the background model content okay so we haven't actually set the background so let's give a border radius order radius to one ram and then we're going to give it a background color to color bg2 like that okay uh okay so the shadow is on the input itself but we need to give the bring the shadow here okay so what we can do is is go to the uh create content create content box Shadow and remove this uh actually copy this and go to the content by the way if you want you can remove this content all together the oops where's the model oh there it is so you can move this model content you can put this these styles on the form directly if you want to all right uh yeah I'll do this and there it is uh now we just need to give this uh border radiuses and stuff so let's go to the input control tasks uh we should be create content so input control we need to uh style more okay so um let's see let's see what we need to do first so first off we need to give it uh border radius uh and let's see what color Okay input water radius for radius let's do one ram it should work oh what I said here I think one R is too much let's do 0.5 okay let's see how it looks so it looks all right 0.5 looks okay uh you can you know put whatever you want here uh the other thing I think that I might want to do is reduce this margin bottom I think I'll well I put it to 08 okay so it should be yeah a bit lower I think we have good spacing uh the other thing that we need to style is the button okay but first off uh let me check what styles I used for that button so if you remember this button component here so we need to render the button component component button component type submit okay and then uh we need to give this an icon this should be a soft closing okay and then we have the name should be create task and then we're going to have icon the icon so the icon we're using here let's do plus and make sure you import this plus icon okay and I'm just going to paste in the rest of the properties okay so we have padding but radius font weight font size like that so when I click uh the button is set to Green but it is a lot of padding and also I want to give it a color uh color what did I so we have the pattern is too big that's to 0.8 and then two Ram okay uh I think let's do Flex FX end end can't remember the property I think jusy end okay so I want it to be here at the right here okay uh the color I don't think we have a prop for this one so let's go to the button and do a color okay let's add the color color here and then we're going to do color all right so wait col let let's do gray Zero by default let's see color color color let's check it out I'm the console okay so I'm not really fond of this color let's try color background let's do color green should be light okay I'll get rid of this prop color wait a minute let me check the green light uh let's go to the themes light here green light there's something wrong with this variable here but let's try this purple color I should copy the variable name c primary let's see what that looks like okay I think this is but it doesn't match our theme though okay uh we let me check this one for a minute we want something that is close to our theme so let me look for a button I'll inspect here I'll copy this color here by the way this website is not yet responsive uh okay so I'll copy this color here I like it all right I think this is reasonable and the icon so we need to Target the submit button submit BTN select that uh collapse and then we go and sty that separately okay and then I'm going to take the button submit button BTN button and then I'm going to I'm going to given icon I color okay I think I think that works well when I have her and have uh let's try to set the background color green dark we need to overwrite that with the important uh why is it not working so let's see why inspect it should be just background not background color all right so hopefully it should work okay we need to too important still not working background RGB color primary [Music] dark okay we didn't have that variable so that's why we had an issue and the color should be color white color white I don't know if it's showing was the colors are quite similar okay this is now white okay I think this would do uh let's do transition this should be .3 okay so now let's uh refresh okay so now we can have a I don't know about this white color though you you can try to find whatever color that you want all right and I think the are other things that we need to do is to do this date okay we need to start this you know date icon okay so let's inspect here okay so we need to give this a class this the radio buttons we need to give them a class okay so completed I'm going to give them a class of Toler completed as well as uh this one oh this one is a class of Toler as well so down here I'm going to Target those I want to do display flex and Al items to Center okay and uh there it is I'm just going to do justify content just content now let's do space between okay uh wait not the label I want to do the to completed okay uh Flex black shrink we need to shrink Flex shrink Z zero actually it's grow Flex Pro should be zero right and this one should be Flex one FX one margin bottom there's an issue with margin bottom uh margin Ram here okay and uh yeah there it is I think it's too big Toler label Flex we're going to do Flex one like that so we want this label to fill the entire width okay and this one uh Flex grow zero some reason oh I think give it a width nothing happens let's try this nothing happens okay so we need to remove the width here label and it should be in input in the Toler and then we need to remove remove the width with uh let's set it to initial like that okay so now we if we click this one it should tole and then we just need to set the cursor to pointer okay so we able to to go some reason the cursor pointer is not working but fear not let's go we need to keep going we need to style the date okay so for the date I'm just thinking we need to go to the global CSS so in the global CSS I'm going to Target the input input and then type equal to date I'm going to style the indicator okay so type web kit calendar indicator pick indicator and then filter I'm just going to invert the color the color is black so I'm going to invert it to one which is going to set it white okay it's going to be the opposite of that so we're going to do font size I'm going to make it bigger I'm going to do 1.5 frame and I'm am going to set the cursor to pointer so it should be a bit bigger now so when I click we can select the date okay we can toggle so we also need to uh do checkbox as well input uh we need to do checkbox type equal to checkbox okay uh I don't I'm not sure if this is how we start with the checkbox okay so let me CSS check box okay so we should let's see how we can start this checkbox it's the better one okay container okay I get it so this one is going to take us a while so we have to do a lot of positioning and stuff uh you can do this on your own spare time I don't have time to create a custom checkbox okay so we just going to use the default one but I think I'll do this off camera and then I'll just push the changes on the final version that I'm going to upload on GitHub but now we just need to now we are able to add code add stuff hello okay so now we can toggle completed so when I create task should create but it's not refreshing so we need to manually refresh the page for us to see that okay so I'm going to delete so we need to refresh the data every time that we create a new task and as well as we might need to close actually I think you might want to close this right when you create a new task or you want to keep it open it's up to you but but me I'm just going to close it so it's up to you what you want to you can do what you want so create content so we have the submit button submit what function are we calling here okay so for us we need to go into the submit and submit so somewhere here we need to get all tasks tasks or tasks okay so here we are going to do this all tasks we can do this first or we can do this after okay so we are just calling all tasks and you might want to close the model if you want when the task is successful you can close the model okay and I'm just going to say close model like that and make sure sure you get close model uh here close model I'm I'm also going to do one more final one final check here so I'll take this I'm going to say if not data if not response do data do error that's when I want to do this okay so I'm going to save uh test data hello and then I'll put a date put a date to it and then I'm going to to it make important and then I'm going to say completed and then create task okay but the close model did not work um let's see why okay so our tasks is not a function or tasks tasks okay because we're not sending that through okay we need to send all tasks like this so now I think we should be able to do it hello to just add something random and create new task there it is so it's working so we can delete this so next we just need to work on making sure the new task is at the top okay so this is going to be the final part so we're going to look at uh media queries and also I want the newly created data to be at the at the top okay so when we create something it's going at the bottom so I'm just going to add something random and then when I create it's you know down here so we want the newly created one to be at the top so what we're going to do we're going to be uh sorting the data based on the created date okay so we're just going to check uh what date uh it was created okay so what I'm going to do let's go to the global I'm going to close everything here let's open the global context only so uh let's go to all tasks okay so for all tasks uh let's uh sort the data before we put the data in the state okay so what we're going to do uh let's CG response. data we need to get rid of the consoles actually I'm always forget so if we go in the console now we need to refresh this uh so there's a created at date here so we need to sort okay so uh let's say sorted so we're going to return a new array equal to not response we can do yeah response. data response do data and then we're going to sort so it's going to take uh two values so A and B okay so to sort these we just need to subtract A and B okay okay so we're going to return so we're going to return new date okay so it's going to be new and then it's going to be date and then because the date it's in a it's in this format we want to convert it to the proper format that we want so new date and then we're going to say B do created at created at created at like this okay and then Dot get time get time like this subtract a to created it to get time okay so let's let's see CG a b okay actually let's uh console log remove this sorted sorted uh let's refresh so we should be able to see sorted here okay so the newly created array will be at the beginning okay uh and I'm going to put the sorted data as our tasks okay in the state so the data and the state going to be sorted based on the created Created at date okay so the newly created will be at the top okay so if you want to get the opposite effect you don't need to do anything but if you want to get the opposite effect using the sort you can just do a minus B okay like this okay so sometimes I always get confused with this one as well sometimes I start with a minus B and then I realize I need to switch it around so B minus a like that so the newly created data now and let's delete some of these so the newly created data hello world and then I just add something random I'll mark this as important and then I'm going to create uh there it is yellow world so when I go to important you're going to see it it's at the top as well and then completed same thing do it now okay so here we we're getting the ones which are not completed so if you mark it is complete it's change the uh the status it will be in the completed okay and then uh all of the task will be showing here so now what we need to do uh we need to do the media queries okay so for the media queries uh I'm going to inspect so at uh small size which is let's say 750 750 pixels at 750 pixels I am going to reduce this padding to one ram okay so one ram I think I should do the same for this one in between okay okay let me check how that would look like uh Gap Gap uh let's do one ram okay yeah so Gap one ram I think that makes sense so at 750 we are going to uh let's see what component we need to do this one so the parent of sidebar so let's go to layout actually I think it's the global star provider so we have the children in here okay grid uh Gap okay padding here so at media screen we're going to do end Max width so for our Max width it's going to be the small screen and media screen it should be inside like this okay I need to put my phone on silent okay so max width like this uh padding I'm going to set that to one ram and GAP one ram okay so now as you can see now we set to one ram like that and uh the other thing that we want maybe you can add a transition maybe transition let's see how that looks like okay so there's a bit of a transition so it doesn't snap okay so now what we need to do uh I am going to position fix this nav okay so copy the nav copy this Styles and go to the nav sidebar so I'm going to look for the sidebar there it is okay so I'm going to paste the media I'm going to say position fixed all right so there it is I'm going to give it a height should be 100% like that uh minus actually let's do c minus one ram for the you know that padding like that uh it should be two Ram I think yep like that and let's give it a z index Z index uh 100 or 10 okay so then it will be at the top now so we want it to be translated off screen but let's add a button here first okay uh let's Name It We need to name it dot Togo nav okay so toona let's make it a button actually you can make it a div if you want uh I think I can't remember what I've can't remember the icon name so I need to go to the YouTu and check B edit can't remember what I've named the icon I think it's bars we have like three bars that's that's a that's not a good name okay so there there it is uh I'm going to copy this class I copy I just put it here above the media query position absolute absolute position absolute right we're going to set it to Manus through RAM and then top let's set it to 10 Ram actually let's do five RAM and then let's give it a padding of let's do one R for now and then border top radius top right radius let's do one ram and Border bottom right rise let's do one R and uh we need to give it we need to give it a background color it should be color pg2 I believe this should be the pting should be 0.5 actually no the Border radius 0.5 Ram 0.5 Ram uh okay we probably want to animate okay so font awesome I don't know why I was looking at this picture Wednesday oh one of my friends was looking for a costume for Halloween so I was looking to see uh the character she was looking for uh font awesome font awesome oops okay so we need to look for the home um actually menu that's the one we want oh it's called bars actually uh let's do bit all right I'll copy this with the animation and let's go to the icons and replace class name okay and we need Arrow so it should be let's click free Arrow left where's the left Arrow there it is and and let's make the animation it should be yep same uh let's edit here so by the way you can do the icons any way that you prefer but I prefer this way Arrow left class name and then uh let's go so we need to conditionally uh render so let's go to the global State we need to create a new state to see if the sidebar is collapsed or not so I'm going to say con collapsed okay and I'm going to send the collapse yeah collapsed okay so I'm going to check if it's collapsed uh where would sidebar sidebar okay so we need to get the collapsed here collapsed okay so collapsed okay so here so collap so if it's collapsed we are going to show the bars or if it's not collapsed we going to show left Arrow so make sure you Arrow left so make sure you import like this okay from the icons perfect so we should have the animated Arrow here because it's not collapsed Okay so I think uh I might want to increase the pading that border radius to one and border right border right for the top and Border bottom like that okay so let's uh reposition this right minus 3 RAM let 2 minus 30 pixels all right so I think minus 73 pixels is good right 73 pixels and uh this one should be padding top and bottom let's do 6 RAM and one R like that uh doesn't look good it's 2.88 doesn't look good either let's do on both sides and then we' need to uh adjust this okay I think this will do so - 66 pixels and top let's do two Ram okay uh 1.8 so you kind of find the balance of what you like okay so now when I click I want to collapse okay so uh uh let's go to the global I'm going to say con collapse menu like that all right so collapse menu we're just going to we did set the collapse me to the opposite of what the state is so by default it's false so when you click it's going to go true or false depending on this state okay so now uh let's just go and run this function here collapse menu is going to be true when we click so let's get the collapse menu uh on click we want to run the collaps menu okay so now let's see if it's changing the icon okay as you can see the icon is changing based on the collapse okay and we'd want to make it go away so uh let's put the collapse collaps as a prop equal to collapsed all right so we're getting an issue here because we're using typescript so we need to say theme I going to set it to any let's not worry about them let's just set the collapse to bullan because this t t script that's why we're getting that warning so we set it to Boolean so we want to check if it's collapsed so collapsed uh I'm going to say transform transform okay and we're going to to translate X okay but actually we need to check first uh props do collapsed do collapsed and then we're going to set it to minus 100 if collapse is equal to True uh we're going to translate x - 100% else 0 to the normal position and then I'm going to do a transition so the transition I'm going to use is going to be a cubic cubic Bia again or basier I don't know how to pronounce it so the one we used it's in the layout so if you go to the layout if you remember here I want to use this animation here I'm going to do a transition transition like this all right so let's see when I click okay so there it is it's going away uh I think it should be let's inspect I want it to be off screen uh let's do now so it's minus 100 okay so I want to leave space like this I think yeah like this so it should be out of the screen so it should beus 107 % okay minus 107 I think I'm going to also increase the padding ping top and bottom left and right I'll just do one9 Ram like that okay looks quite pretty good uh we just need to rwe this why does it uhing all right so I think minus 69 works fine 69 all right so the nav we can collapse it okay I think that's the effect we're looking for so let's see how it looks on mobile so let's do iPhone 12 so what we can do also is we can reduce the font size I'm looking for Iphone 12 Pro okay so this phone size if it's too big for you we can reduce it so all right you can also Center this around so yeah uh it looks pretty good on smaller screens you can reduce this picture size as well uh okay so I think oh I forgot to do something something so uh collapsed is set to True okay so I need to check something I want the collapse to only do on mobile okay so what I'm going to do I'm going to do media query media query sidebar I'll copy this a cut it should be at the top here position fixed I'm going to cut this uh Tok enough I'm going to say display to none all right so I don't want this and then here display display to block it should be the toona that I want to set the display to block like that and then we save so they should be okay it's still not showing to enough display none oh we need to put the media query oh wait we are in the media so the screen size to off weird Okay so the media query doesn't show there let's do important let's see okay there it is okay so it's collapsed all right so like that all right so now I can collapse this when I make the screen bigger okay so when you're going down like this and then just going to hide all right perfect so the media queries is pretty much done I think the only thing that we can work on is the font size you can copy this media screen size here we can go body uh Global uh at media like that because we're not we canot nest what can reduce the whole thing to 15 pixels I think okay or you can do font size I think 50% let's see how this looks I think it's too small all right you can work around this font size here depending on what component and you want to change the font size on all right I think I'll just keep the font size that we have even for smaller screens I think it's it's fine it's fine to me so it depends what you want okay so now um the only thing that that we have I'm going to sign out let's start these Pages here so uh we're just going to do that in line so sign up we're going to do it in line so we're going to say class name Flex item Center justify Center so we want to Center this so we are in sign up so let's see sign up okay so we want to give the height to four Ed full okay so it should be centered here there it is and we want to do the same thing for sign sign in and we should just Center this so it's just basically display Flex align Center we height for to 100% And align items and justify content Center okay and uh that's it we can disable these uh components by the way you can start this however you want if you want to so for example if you want to remove this you can just inspect this and look for a class so this is the class Name by the way you cannot select the locked class so make sure you always select the one which is not locked you copy that and then you style that based on the class that that is not locked so if I want to disable this I can just select the class and then say display To None or whatever you can start this whatever you want okay so I think that's pretty much it let me try to log in back again so sign in so because I'm already have an account I'll go to the signin page and then we're going to continue with Google and voila uh we are in the application now so if you want to make any more tweaks you can do what you want if you want to uh make a request you can send me an email I'm sure you've seen my email already this is my email you can send me an email you can request any video or if you want to see anything in the future you can let me know in the comment section and yeah don't don't forget to like comment and subscribe I'll see you on the next one\", metadata={'source': 'OHvfgaDl-yY', 'title': 'Task Manager Coding Project Tutorial – Next.js, React, Prisma,

for tuning in let's get started so in order to start developing with C we need to install install the latest version of visual studio in this case it's currently 2022 so let's head over Google and type in Visual Studio 2022 download we will be presented with two links we have this one and this one we want to use a second one which says download visual studio tools so if you press on that and now we present it with the download area we have three additions Community professional Enterprise Community is free for students open source contributors and individuals which is exactly what we need for the content of this course we have the professional Enterprise Edition which paed for and only used by bigger companies or smaller teams so let's go ahead and press free download the download will start straight away after the download is complete let's start the installer so double click on the executable and press yes to allow it for admin permissions it'll pop up like this Visual Studio installer before you get started we need to set up a few things you can configure your installation you can read the privacy policy in the software terms if you'd like or you can just press continue so it's getting the visual studio installed already so so when you get to this section everything here is all the different packages and tools you can install within Visual Studio 2022 the main one that we're concerned within the content to this cause is the neck desktop environment so you can go ahead and press this one it will then tell you in the bottom right hand corner the total space required is 6.52 GB please make sure you have enough storage space available for this and then you can go ahead and press install if you want to check out other packages you can have a scroll through and read any other packages you may need and may want to install like I said the the only one required for this course is the net desktop environment you can also deal with noj development python development web development if you need to deal with individual components like specific versions you can access it here if you need some more languages installed you can access it here this should automatically select your default language for you that's based on your systems language and if you want it to you can also change the installation location in case you want to install it on a different drive or you just want it in a different folder so now that we selected the neck desktop environment ment we can go ahead and press the installation button we do have two options down here we have it install while downloading and it download all then install if you have a reasonably fast computer you can stick with the install while downloading and it will do the installation and the downloading at the same time if you have a slow computer it's preferred that you use this option to download it first and then install it just means that it won't slow down your computer too much so you can go for this one and press install now the installation will begin so now that visual studi finish installing it will say done installing Visual Studio has been successfully installed we recommend rebooting soon to clean up any remaining files so this just means restart on your computer just so it has a chance to clean up any files that were kept during the installation process so we can just press okay if you have any other versions of Visual Studio installed they'll also show up down here now that Visual Studio Community 2022 is installed we can just press launch so now it'll prompt you to sign into Visual Studio we should definitely sign in but just for now I'm going to skip but feel free to create an account or sign in if you already have one existing we can skip this and then we get to choose your theme I personally prefer the Dark theme but you can go with blue blue extra contrast or the light mode so let's select dark and hit start Visual Studio it will do a first time setup and it's already done and we're already inside Visual Studio 2022 so that's it for the visual studio installation so now that we got Visual Studio 2022 installed let's let's see how to create your first project so once you've opened Visual Studio 2022 you'll see this window popping up you can clone a repository from things like GI Hub in as you devops or open a project that you already have or open a folder which may have projects inside or you can create one from scratch if you don't want to do any of these options you can just open the visual studio program just on its own by clicking continue without code so let's go down the create a project path so click on create a new project and we'll get a list of all these different projects inside our system to be able to use the ones we going to be focusing on on this course is going to be C in the languages dropdown box and the platform is going to be windows and the project type is going to be console and they have one that uses net core which is for Linux Mac and windows and one that uses the Net Framework which is Windows so we want to go for this one so press on this one and then press next here we have our project name our location and our console app so we can start with the project name and say my first project as you can see it start copying over to the solution name as well and it tells you where the project will be created into so I'll be creating a folder called my first project which is the solution name plus my first project which is the project name inside that folder if we change the solution name you'll see update you can see here now we have multiple T's because we appended the solution name the solution name is almost like a folder that holds lots of projects inside so to begin with we'll have one solution that has one project inside and then later on in the course if you feel like you want to add more project projects to it you can just add more to this solution so let's get started and press create so now we've created our very first project and just to explain what's here we have a static main void which is the main entry point to our program if you do a lowercase M then the system is not going to recognize this main function because the down NET Framework requires this function to be found in order to run a c console app and you can see here in the errors the program does not contain a static main function and you can see it's capital M and C programming language is K sensitive so make sure to include it so now you understand how to use Visual Studio 2022 to create a project and also know where the main entry point is in C let's get started with Hello World example to kick off this course so as we know our main entry point to our application is the static void main if we go inside here and press enter then we can actually start writing some code inside here just a quick note before we continue static void main is inside the class program and the class program is inside the namespace hello world and the reason why you can tell this is because of the curly braces the curly braces of hello world begins here and ends here and Within These curly braces we have a class program and also within the class program we have the styo men so just between these curly braces we want to type console. right line open the brackets and we can type in some speech marks and we can simply Type Hello World there you go so as you can see now system has actually been highlighted so if we just delete this line you can see now system has been gr out and the reason why is it says it's unnecessary because it hasn't been used so if you undo it then this comes up because I showed you before that console right line is actually within the system Library what happens if we delete it if we delete it then it doesn't know where console exists from and because that just said system we can actually just use system. console. right line and then open the brackets and type in hello world and now this works again and the reason why this works it's because we don't have to Define that we're using system we could just use it straight in here if you have multiple lines like this then you don't want to be using syst right at the start ideally you want to have the reference to it at the top of the screen and then use it throughout so now that we've included back in the project you can see that now these have turned gray and it says that it can be simplified if we press the light bulb and we can say simplify member and it doesn't really matter because we can just delete the rest now so now that we've WR hello world let's press F5 which is a shortcut to the start button as you can see well you couldn't really see because the program closed too quickly and the reason for that is printed hello world to the console and then it didn't do anything else CU there's nothing else for it to do so the console simply closed we can use another command called console read Line open the brackets and close the brackets and have a semicolon at the end all this does is it waits here until the user inputs something reads the next line of characters from the standard input stream so although the program will actually be reading stuff we you just want this line to stop the application from closing so now if you press F5 and run the program you can see it actually says hello world and it's just waiting here flushing and this flashing means it just started this console read line so it doesn't matter what we type into here it just waits for us to press enter and as soon as we press enter this line executes and the program finishes congratulations you just wrote your first C program welcome to the amazing journey of programming so let's look at how to make variables in our C codee let's start every code with a console read line and then we can hit F5 just to make sure our console doesn't close so let's begin with an integer so integers are whole numbers so we can just say int age equals 23 so what we've actually done here is we've said we want an INT we want to call it age already made it equal to 23 this is called initializing and declaring in the same line line so what you could do alternatively is you can end the semicolon here and it just says int Edge and then on the next line you can write ede equals 23 so this is declaring it in the first line and then give it an initial value in the second line if they're right underneath each other like this case then you may as well just make it together because then you have less lines of code the reason why it says it's a green under line it's because there the unnecessary assignment because we're not actually using age so let's just print ede to the console if we make some new lines and we can type in console. right line and then press tab to finish it we can write Edge and if we run our code using F5 we can see that 23 gets print out to the screen so now that we've worked on the Edge Let's explore all data types so let's define a long variable so let's start with the type long followed by space and then the variable name that we want and let's add equals and type in a very big number so now if we hover over it it says it's a system int32 and int32 2 is actually an integer but we're telling it it's a long which makes no sense we have an in 64 here but when we hover over the number it comes up as n32 and the reason for that is when C sees that you just have a number typed in like this it will always assume that it is an integer to tell the compiler that you indeed want this to be processed as a long number then you can put a capital l right at the end now if we hover over it it says N64 and this says in 64 so so now we've got it working and we've got the long there so now we can take another console right line and just print this out to the screen and just a helpful tip if you type in CW and press tab twice then you get the console right line it's very easy to write your code and then you can type in big Follow by a tab and it'll come up straight away so as you can see they're both being printed to the console now so now that we've made positive numbers we can also make these negative by simply just putting a negative sign behind them there we go and just to show you how big these numbers are what we can do we can type in int. max value and then make another one using contr D and type an int. Min value so you can see integers can be positive 2.1 billion or negative - 2.1 billion and if we do the same for long you can see that long is a very very big number because instead of being an INT 32 it's an int64 which takes up a lot more memory so now we've covered whole numbers let's have a look at decimals so we can have a double negative for example and we can say it's minus 55.2 and in this case when you just have a number typed in like this and it's got a decimal point in it it will always register it as a double but just to make sure just as we're doing with the long you can actually just put a capital D at the end now if we print this out to the screen and also print out how big these numbers can be max value and Min value and print this out so we get our minus 55.2 and you can see that these numbers can be very big e + 308 means it's this number times by 10 to the^ of 308 which is a very big number and we also have that as a negative so we have float let's call this precision and make equal 5.1 and then put a semic call at the end now we've got a problem here this is trying to register as a double but we don't want to register double we want to register as a float and this is the same issue we have the long so when you type any number that has a decimal point in it the C compiler will always register as a double the same way when you type in a whole number it'll always register as an INT so in this case we need to put a capital f at the end and it'll process this as a Flo so now we can print this out and then let's just print out the max values and the Min values just to show you what that looks like so as you can see here we have our number printed out and again we have quite a big number 3.4 * 10 to the^ of 38 so again it's a big number and we have that positive and negative so quite a big range of numbers and the last one we're going to cover is decimal for things like money and currency 14.99 and again in this case it's trying to assign a double into a decimal so in order to denote what a decimal is you can put a capital M right at the end and for one last time let's print out the money and the decimal. max value contrl D and then we'll do Min value and you can see here that this is a really big number as well and it's even bigger than the long so we have our number printed and the Max and the minimum values so now that we've understood that how to declare a variable I have an extra little tip for you so if we had three variables int X and int Y and in in Z and let's say you're always going to declare them together like this you can actually miss out and do X comma y comma Z and that will do exactly the same thing there you go and that's really neat and it's a lot better let's say for example you had these variables but you actually had them set to something like equals 10 = 20 = 30 this is still practical but it might look a little uglier so you can actually type them in straight into here and if you comment these out again then it still works you can even put these onto new lines like this just so it looks a bit neater just prevent you from typing the additional int each time if they're all going to be the same variable type so that's it for the numbers inside our code so let's just have a quick recap so in order to Define a variable you want use the data type in this case an integer followed by the variable name and then you can either add a semicolon at that point or you can add a equals to give it a value this is just called declaring a value and this is called initializing a value if you want to decide you want to change the variable further down your program for example age equals 50 here then this is fine and this is now called an assignment it's called initialization because as soon as you make it you give it a value value and then in later on in the code if you give it another value this is called simply assigning a value this is just called assigning it a value so now that we can store numbers in C let's see how we can store characters and letters so as you know from the introduction we have a string variable so let's call that name and make it equal to Aba please note that when you're defining a string and giving it a value that this value needs to be in speech mark if you put it in quotation marks it will not accept this because that's the notation to declare a Char which we'll get on to next so on the next line we can do a Char letter equals and we can't have something like this because the Char will only accept One Singular character so we have to wrap it around the quotation mark once you've wrapped it around the quotation mark then it will accept it so let's print these two to the screen so CW tab tab and we can just print these to the screen and if we just run the code you can see that we've got the values entered in here we can start to write stuff your name is and then we can output this and we can also put it on one line if we do a console right and a console right then maybe we can take the callon off and just have it space and we can say your name is ABBA and we've seen that additional a because that's the right line for the letter so we can space it out with an empty conso right line and they'll add a gap between them both there we go so now we know how to declare a string variable and give it a value and we can declare a Char variable and also give it a value just a quick recap when you're declaring and initializing string variables you need to put the value in speech marks but when you're declaring and initializing a Char you don't have to put it in speech marks you put them in apostrophes whenever you see apostrophes that that can only ever refer to One Singular character when you see a speech mark it could be one or more characters also things can be empty this just means the string is empty this is also a valid character it just means that we're storing a string but it has no value with a Char that's not exactly the same you can't store an empty character literal it has to be given something Charles get defaulted at back sl0 which is just a default character but don't worry about that too much now we'll go into Escape characters which is the back SL later on in the course for now just knowe that whenever you declare a string variable we need to put it in the speech marks and when we're declaring a Char variable we need the quotation mark So now that we know how to define numbers in C and to also Define strings and characters then let's look at how to convert between them both so let's take some similar code from our first video and we can Define it age the number the negative the Precision and the money and we give it the same values from the first video we simply just print them out to the console here and if we just run we can see them all but this doesn't help us cuz we're just statically typing in the numbers what if these were actually processed as string and we want to convert them into an INT so just above each of the variables we're going to make another variable so we can say a string text age equals -23 and then for the age what we're going to use is this function called convert to in32 and we can put in the string inside the brackets and what this is now saying is we're taking our string text Edge which is equal to -23 and we're passing it into this function convert to in32 and the reason why in32 is because an INT is by definition an in32 which is a 32bit signed integer so what we want to do here is convert for our text age into an int32 and store it back into our int and hopefully we should see the same value when we hit run 23 so now that's actually went from a string variable and then went into our integer and we've printed out as an integer and it's no longer a string variable now we can do the same for the other ones so we can have a string text big number and make it equal to this value just in the quotation marks now we're typing this value in the quotation marks we don't need to put the L at the end the L is just to tell the compiler that we want to use N64 if we take the L away then it's going to think it wants in32 this is not re applicable when it comes to text because we're going to explicitly stay on the next line we want to convert to N64 so the compiler already knows that it's in 64 and we don't need to put an L at the end now let's make sure this works and there we go so what we should end up with is the console should look exactly the same as how we had it at the start of the video but actually what we're doing is converting it from a string into the applicable value string text negative = - 55.2 and then in here we can do convert to double add the text negative inside here and let's just run it to check and we still have the same value so it's going well okay a string text Precision make it equal to this and then instead of this we can have a convert to and in this case it's actually going to be a single and the reason why it's a single when you hover of a float the definition for a float is indeed a single so we can add that in text precision and we're just going to do the last one just check it all together text money equals 14.99 and then instead of this we can have a convert and let's have a look at this a decimal is indeed a decimal so we can say two decimal and then add the text money in perfect now if you run the line of code we can see that all of these values are exactly as we had them now they're being represented by their official descriptions Based On A String conversion as I mentioned before in the error video the problem you'll have with this is if this value actually has a character inside you will get a runtime error this can be fixed in the future when we look at how to resolve these errors and we can have exception handling and use functions like trass so we can try and avoid these exceptions occurring because when these exceptions occur the rest of our code does not run and it becomes fatal at this point but for now don't worry about this too much just get used to the notation and how these things work so this video we're going to focus on the booing data type so we can make a Boolean data type by saying Bo value equals true this Boolean value is literally just a true or false value we can store anything in here and maybe something like bull is male and we can just say it true and later on our code booleans are used to make decisions we'll cover this in the next section of this course but boings are mainly used for making decisions if one thing is equal to another thing then we can take another path or if something is true or something is false then we can do another path for example if you make an output to the user you could check if this value is true and if the value is true then you can address the user as a male and if the value is false then you can address the user as a female these are the kind of things that booleans can help us with and just like any variable if you want to assign it later on you can just assign it again and if we print these out to the screen just like that you'll just see the value is true and the values false appear on the screen as of right now in the course there's not a whole lot to do with booing just understand that they can hold a true or false value so now that we know how to define different variables and how to convert between them let's see how we can perform operations on different data types let's say we could have an INT age equals 23 and then what we can do to that age is we can say Age ++ and what this age will do is it will actually just increment age by one and if we do age minus minus it will decrement it by one so if we just print it out after and after this as well what we'll notice is there'll be no change CU it'll go forward one and then back one there we go went from 23 plus plus to 24 and then minus minus to 23 that's one of the important operators that you'll see a lot especially during the next section of this course so another way to be able to add one to a variable or anything to a variable we can replace this with age equals age + 1 and what we're seeing here we want age to have the value of itself added to one which will give us the same result is doing h++ another way of writing this is a quick shorthand is you can say age plus equals 1 these three things are doing exactly the same thing when you do an age Plus+ you can only increment by one and only one these two options give you the flexibility of having something like 10 these two are doing exactly the same age equals age + 10 and this is going to read exactly the same thing it's is when you use plus equals it will take the value of the current variable and add it to 10 which exactly what this line does to make it a lot shorter you can use age plus equals and then just put the value at the end just in case you forget to mention age twice so now if we just get rid of these two lines of code and we can just have a look and see if this runs so now the value should be 33 perfect and now as we said we're going to cover plus minus times and divide so just as you did with plus equals you can actually do a minus equals as well which will give us 13 and you can do a times equals which should give us 230 now if we try to do divide equals we're going to run into an issue it says 2 23 / 10 is 2.3 and when you take 2.3 and make it into an integer it's just going to truncate the3 and leave you with two with integers if you add two integers or take away two integers or times them you'll always end up with an integer if you divide two integers you don't know what you'll end with for example if you make this into 20 then you'll always end up with two but that's not always the case as you just saw 23 / 10 is 2.3 so if you're ever going to do any division it's best to actually make this a double cuz now that we do the division we actually get 2.3 which is technically the right value so you can add minus times and divide any variables that you want these are just demonstrated in int and double but you can do this the Flor the decimal Etc so let's have a look and see what the plus and the minus operators do when you've got a string variable so we can have a string name equals abber and then we can say the name plus equals is programming and then we can just print out name to the screen and see what happens so there you go you've actually just joined two strings together they're completely separate from each other and we've made them string together so if we try to do a minus equals you can't really remove from a string because a string is just text it'll be very difficult for the compiler and for the C language to be able to determine what's currently in the string and whether you can remove it or not this is not something that's built into the language this is not something that's built into the language so let's remove that and we can have the same thing with the TR now the problem with the Char is if we add a to B then let's see what happens to the output what it will try and do is actually get the uni code values for both of these items and try and add them together as integer variables so when you add a and b it will take the unic code value and you will actually get a capital A with a squiggle at the top and if we open character map you can see that this squiggle at the top is right here here which is unic codee 61 and 61 actually means 97 because it's 6 * by 16 + the 1 and b means it's 6 * 16 which is 96 + the 2 so you have 97 and 98 and if you add them two values together you'll get the hex code which is C3 just for this character so what you're doing is you're kind of adding them both together and you're producing weird results so unless you really want to do this then you should be worried about adding two characters together one more thing to note about when you're doing Plus+ let's bring another int variable we just say int I equal Z then we can do i++ and then if we print out I the value should be one which is fine what if we did i++ but we did Plus+ I so the value is still going to be one but what happens if we put this i+ plus straight into these brackets let's try and run it and you'll still get the value is zero that's strange because we've said I ++ and what happens when you do Plus+ at the front it will actually execute this and return the value of I and then do the Plus+ so if you actually print the value of I after you'll realize that now it becomes one after if you have had a situation where you need to increment first and then use the value you can use plus plus I now if you run it you should see the value is one twice the difference is that as the plus pluses before the VAR aable name it tells the compiler please do this action first and then return back the I if you don't want that behavior then use i++ finding the remainder between the division of two integer variables can be very handy when you're determining whether a number is even or odd let's look at an example let's have it in first Nome design the value of 10 and in second n and give it the value of three now if we just printed the screen first n divided by second n what do you think you'll get so the value of this in the calculator would be 3.3 reoccurring so we'd actually just get three because it's truncating it because of the integer so now what happens if we need the remainder between both of these you could actually work this out by seeing how many times three would be divided by 10 as close as possible and you'll see is the value is three and then 3 * 3 is 9 which will give you one left over for the 10 but that's a bit too long in our code so we have something called a modulus operator so we can actually change this divide for a percentage sign and what this will outut is it will only give us the remainder so let's say 10 / 3 is 3.3 as we've just said but the remainder is different remainder is exactly how you learned it at school 10 / 3 is actually three remainder 1 because 3 * 3 is 9 and then you have one left over to get to 10 so that'll be 3 * 3 which is equal to 9 and then one left over to get to 10 so now let's run our code and see if we do actually get one there we go so the best way to determine if a value is actually odd or even is to divide it by two so we can say 10 modulus 2 and if the value is zero then that means the value for first num is actually even if the value is one one then it's odd let's see how this works out if we had 10 modulus 2 then the value is zero because 10 can be divisible by two perfectly let's say we had 11 modulus 2 the closest multiple to 11 is 10 which is five and then we have one left over so you just have the remainder is equal to one and if we just keep going up in the chain we'll realize that it's the same pattern every single time you go up a value the value just toggles so when we print this out to the console and the value is actually zero that means the number is even and if we make the number odd on purpose and then rerun the code you can see that it's a number one now which means this value is now odd so let's look at a couple of examples and see if you can figure out the answer if we do a th000 modulus 90 what do you think the value will be and let's write a couple more if we do 100 modulus 90 and maybe something like like 71 modulus 10 so have a think about this in your head and see if you can figure out the answers pause the video and see if you were correct let's take a look at the answers so we can see we have 10 10 and 1 so the closest multiple to 1,000 from 90 is 990 so we have 10 left over to get to 1,000 and the same goes here the closest multiple of 100 to 90 is just indeed 90 so we only have 10 to get from 90 to 100 and in this case the closest multiple of 71 to 10 is 70 and we have one to get up to 71 therefore these two answers are indeed correct so now that we know how to really Define a variable by specifying that type followed by the name and given it a value let's see how we can do a very easy way of defining a variable so normally we would type in Edge but we can use this VAR keyword and what this means is the compiler will figure out what type it needs to be based on the value we initialize it with so if we just make a variable called age then it's not going to like it because you need to give it a value this doesn't give the compiler enough information to figure out what this variable is going to be just because it says age this is just text to the compiler this does not mean anything so if you make it equal to 23 then the compiler can see that this is indeed int 32 because it knows that so now if you hover over VAR it says in32 now let's try and do this for the big number our big number equals 90,000 and what will happen now is because it's defined as in32 it's going to say this is in32 as well and this is the same issue we had we'll move first def finding the long variable in the first video we need to explicitly give it an L just so this knows that it's N64 and now the VAR has updated to an in 64 instead of rewriting each one we can just change each to V and inspect what happens double double and now we have a float single single and finally the decimal we have a decimal and we have a decimal and the same thing goes for a string we can say V name equals ABA and we can have a v letter equals a there we go and they'll both register as there pickable data types as a string and as a CH and if we just print this out to the screen to make sure everything's working fine and run the code you can see that everything is exactly how we'd expect so just a quick recap you don't have to do this at the end of the day this will be exactly the same as writing this because when our code gets compiled down it doesn't matter what these things are cuz the compiler will deal with it however way it wants to this is just for us to read it in some cases if the value is very obvious like as we know an age cannot really be a point 23.1 years old no one says that in real life when you get asked your age so we can just assume that this value is going to be an integer and that's fine because that's an easy number that's an easy example but if we say we want a negative or a big number then it doesn't really tell us what we're meant to be like this big number could be somewhere up to 2.1 billion which is what an integer supports but in this case if it's going to be a big number and we specified the L then we're going to need a really big number bigger than 2.1 billion so in my honest opinion it would be very beneficial to only use VAR if it's very obvious what the variable is going to be and what it's been assigned to using VAR too much might hurt the readability of your code in the future because you have to inspect each variable individually to read what the type is going to be if you're scrolling through your code and you can see that this is along very quickly and you don't have to hover over it then it can improve your read time this is really important as readability of code will make more sense when it comes to Big projects when you have 20 30 lines just like this project then it makes almost no difference cuz it only takes a couple of seconds when you have big functions and big software when you work at a job then it's going to be very difficult to be able to find your way around and to understand what's going on especially if you're new to the code something very simple like this where you know you're defining a name it's very obvious and V will be accepted fine because you can tell that this is always going to be a string there's no other data type in C gets specified by a speech mark whereas when you're defining numbers it can be very very hard to understand what different data types that people are using throughout the code especially when these numbers are not statically typed in they might be inputs from the console from the user from a different function from anywhere so having good variable names along with their explicit types will be very handy to understand code in the future so now that you've understood how to make a variable let's look at a concept called constants so we defined a variable called vat and we set it to 20 just to represent the 20% vat in the UK now later on in the program we can actually change it to anything we want and that's because it's a variable variables can change in certain circumstances like vat you might not want to change it and you want to disable the ability to change it to out the code if it's done accidentally let's say for example you're making a banking application and you want to fix the vat and you don't want anyone else to change it you can add this keyword called const right before the Declaration and now when you go to reassign it you'll get an error message and it says at the left hand side of the assignment so anything before the equal sign has to be a variable property or indexer and in this case if you hover over vat it states that it's a local constant local because there's no access modifier before it and constant because we specified the cons keyword so now if we try and run the code we'll actually get a compile error because the vat cannot be changed so if we remove that and then we just print out to the console using CW tab tab and then we can put V8 in the brackets and press F5 and now we can see our 20 being printed so let's try and calculate some values using this code if you have an in Balance make it equal to 1,000 and let's say we wanted to calculate the vat based off this then you'd have to do a little bit of a complicated calculation you have to take the balance and because the V is a percentage we need to convert it from decimal to percentage so if we do times and then open the parentheses we can insert vat divided by 800 and just to make sure that this gets processed as double we want to write 100 D cuz right now it's in 32 and if we leave this as an integer division then we'll lose any decimal places and decimal places are very important when it comes to percentages so we put a 100 D at the end now you can see it says double so it'll actually calculate as if it was a decimal number so now if we print that to the screen so we can see here that 20% of the balance is indeed 200 instead of having to do this calculation each time what we can actually do is make another const this I'm making it a double cuz we're not sure what the output of this division will be and we don't want to truncate it so we want it as a double and we can say percent vat and what we can do here when we assign the value just because it's a constant it means that we can't change the value but that also means we can read it as many times as we want so we can say the percentage V is actually the current V that we've got specified here ided 100d this will give us the vat from a number form into a decimal form so now when we do this calculation if we duplicate this line using contrl D we can remove these entire brackets and literally replace it with percentage vat and you should see we get the same values perfect this can be very helpful in the future if you have things like version numbers in your code you can have version 1.0 and then if you ever specify this version later on in your code you can just change it once up here and it will change the rest this can be very helpful you'll avoid a lot of typ and you won't have to redeclare this value several times if you had three different occasions where you displaying the version number in your code then it's going to be problematic once you update the version number and you have to change every single occurrence and you might miss them so inserting it once and only having to change it once is the preferred option just to note with constants when you compile your code all the constants will actually do is do a find and replace so it will take this vat and find all references of vat and just drop the 20 in there so this is more of a feature for maintaining your code from a user and programmer's perspective rather than anything to do with the compiler because when it compiles it just removes all the constant anywhere and then you're left over with the literal values that we've gave it nonetheless this is still something very handy to learn and to use throughout your code first you want to Define a variable to hold your name so we can just say string name equals abber perfect so that's the first one achieved says Define a VAR able to hold your phone number so at first this could be quite easy we could say int number equals and then we can start to type our number in here so now that's our number completed let's move on to holding your age and we can just have an INT age equals 23 print variables line by line to the screen so we can use CW tab tab and type in name and then we can use contrl D to copy and paste the line then we can do number crl D again and then we can use Edge now if we run the code let's see what happens here we've actually hit a slight problem it says 1 2 3 4 for the number but I'm pretty sure that I started off with zero this is a problem with storing your number as an integer as a number zeros at the front don't really matter if we had 100 zeros here then it's not going to change the actual value the only time zeros matter is if it's throughout the number or towards the end that actually changes the number but if we have lots of zeros at the start then it doesn't change anything so what you actually want to do in order to store a number is you want to store it as a string therefore when you run the code it will actually return the zero that we typed in so now that we've accomplished all of these let's see how we can Define the variables using the VAR keyword so if we hover over these you can see that it's picking up that it's a string and a string here and finally this is an integer so what we can do very simply is just change these to VAR and then let's hover over the variables and just see if the tool tip reads the the correct data type string string and integer and if you run the code you should see no difference so in this exercise I want you to create and initialize two integer variables make a variable to work out the remainder output the remainder to the screen and then change the first integer variable to another number recalculate the remainder and output the new remainer to the screen so let's take this step by step so first we need to create an ize two ins let's say int num 1 equals to 10 int num 2 equals to two make a variable to work out the remainder so we can have an INT remainder equals to and if you remember how to do the remainder it uses the modulus symbol which is the percentage sign so we can say num one percentage num two now it says output remainder to the screen so we can use CW tabtab add remainder in and hit run and just for now we can see that the remainder is indeed zero if the remainder is zero then that means 10 is even because 10 modulous 2 gives us zero and if it's zero then that means it's even if the remainder was one then it would mean it's odd so if we try 11 remainder two we get one so 11 is indeed an odd number so let's change this back to 10 and then it says change the first inter variable to another number so just after here we could say num one equal 11 and then recalculate the remainder so we essentially just need to do this section again and we don't need to write into before these two variables cuz int is only used when you're declaring it this is reassigning the variable so we reassign variable num one to 11 and then we reassign the remainder to the calculation again and now we can use the exact same line of code above to print out the remainder to the screen now you can see that it's 0o and one it's zero because 10 is even and it's one because 11 is odd so far throughout the course we've been using console right line to Output stuff to the screen for example I can output hello my name is Aba and we can see it in the console the issue is so far we haven't really wrot any code to be able to read in values from the console so let's explore that option right now so in the console Library we have a console right line but what you don't realize is we can also use this console right line to ask the user a question and to let the user type something in so let's use CW tab tab and say enter your name with a colon and then end the quotation marks and then in order to return a value from the console into your program we need to use console. readline and if you hover over readline let's have a read at description reads the next line of characters from the standard input stream perfect this is exactly what we want to do right now it's to use at the end of our code just to stop the console from closing so we can actually see the output so if we just run this right now we actually get the opportunity to type but when we press enter our program closes this is because in this case we're simply using readline just to wait until the user has pressed enter so so our program doesn't close but what you don't actually see is this is returning as a string which means that anything that we type into here and when we press enter it actually gets a return back to the code but we not doing anything with it because we don't care at this point so now let's actually do something that will make us care about the user's input so we can make a new string variable and assign it to console readline and it should give us the ability to store Whatever Gets entered inside the console so we can just do string name and we can end the semicolon here and if you wanted to on the next line you could do name equals console. readline or if you wanted to have it all in one line then you can get rid of the semicolon and bring it up like this this is the preferred method as both lines were on top of each other and it wasn't really necessary to split them here we're doing a declaration of string name and an initialization and giving it the value of console. readline and this is whatever value the user is going to type in let's run our code and see what happens enter your name abber now when I press enter it's successfully stored abber inside this string name variable and now it's waiting at this line the console read line just right here so when I press enter the program closes so now that we've made a variable and not done anything with it let's print out to the screen to make sure that something's actually worked so if we use CW tab tab and we type in name in the brackets and we can run this code again and let's see what happens as soon as I type in Abba and press enter then this second abber is actually the variable printing out to the screen so here it says enter your name with a colon and normally when you see the colon it sometimes lets you type on the same line so if youd prefer the user to type on the same line then we actually have another function for that instead of using right line we can just use right and the difference between right line and right is the right line will actually have a Terminator at the end of the line to tell the console that he wants to push everything after it onto the next line whereas console. right will just print it out to the screen and not worry about any new lines let's try run it now and now we can type in and as you can see it's a little close to the colon so we can fix that in a second so you press enter you can see now that abber comes up on the second line so if we just put a space after the callon just to give it a bit of room now if we type in abber you can see that there's a bit of a gap and it's quite nicer to look at now if we press enter you can see that Abra has been stored successfully so what we can do now is maybe ask for your age so we can have a console. right enter your age age call on space and then do a string age equals console. readline and then we can have a age output as well and let's see how that works so we can say abber then say 23 and press enter and now we have abber stored within the name variable and have 23 stored within the age variable so let's try and output a string that's a bit more meaningful to the user let's clean this console up and see what we can do so we don't need to Output their result back to the console because they literally just type that in and we don't want to have this line because we just use that as an example so if we run the code right now it'll look better but it does look a lot more structured enter your name and then enter your age so now when you press enter the program will just close so let's try and output these two variables in a formatted fashion so as you now know we can use console. write to print a lot of stuff on one line so we can use console. write and we can say your name is and then add a space and finish that line there and then duplicate it down we can write name duplicate that down and say space and your age is duplicate that one down and then we can type in age and let's see what happens now abber 23 there we go so we actually have the name output and the age output all on one line if we all change these to right lines then they're going to be on separate lines and it's not going to look very nice so I'm just going to introduce you to a notation called string concatenation this is the notion of being able to concatenate two different strings which just means to add one string onto another as you can see this is taken up four lines of chorde and it's getting a bit ugly the better and easier way to do this is by containing it all within one line so we can have a console right line and we can take the first section your name is keep the space at the end we can end the speech marks and put a plus and then we can say name so now we've just added these two together if we just comment out the rest of them and run the code and you can see that they should be on one line there you go so we can say your name is ABBA and let's just keep changing the plus symbol so we can say and your age is another space and the speech marks and plus the age now we've got all of this contained within one line and it looks a lot better enter your name abber and into your age 23 and now you can see exactly the same output but reduced to one line as you can see these three lines are all stuck to each other so if you wanted to add a blank line between these two you can just put an MC console right line just in here and what this will do is simply just print the right line character to the screen which will force the console to make it on the next line just like so here's the console right line from the empty line that we just wrote and this is the console right line to Output the values so now that you've understood how to read values in from the console let's try and convert some values as I showed you how to do it earlier on in the course you can actually convert these strings into integers ideally you want to store variables in their data types as we covered before ages should not be stored as strings they should be stored as integers but if you try and change this to an INT then you're going to have an issue console read line will return back a string so therefore it can't implicitly convert from a string to an integer so we need to do this in two steps we can rename this to age input and then on the line underneath it we can say int age equals convert to int 32 and then add age input in these brackets there we go and now when we actually print the line of code nothing should actually change your name is abber and your age is 23 but now what's actually changed is we're storing the the variables in the correct format this is the ideal method because in the next section when we cover if statements you'll realize why this is very important if you wanted to minimize the amount of steps you need to convert this then you can actually move the console read line and get rid of the string input variable and we can just paste it straight into the bracket of the converter in 32 and you can get rid of the string input variable and everything will work the same AB 23 and now it's working exactly the same if this is many steps for you or if this looks too complicated then just please revert it back just to keep it the same way for the time being so now we've learned how to read in values from the console and output them back to the screen now let's see how we can use if statements to divert our code into multiple paths so in the previous section I told you that it is very crucial for our code to have this int Edge and the reason why is age is meant to be stored as a number and not as a string so we read it in first as a string and and then convert it to an integer using this function and store it into our age variable this is the reason why so our condition goes as follows we write the word if and between the brackets this needs to be evaluated to either a true or false value and then we can have the curly braces to tell us what to do if this becomes true so in this case you want to just check if our age input is greater than or equal to 18 let's say this was an entrance to a place that only allowed overes to enter so we can do a input which references the age input variable and we can use the operators equals greater than greater than or equal to less than or less than or equal to or not equal to so these are all the different options that we have we can say if the age input is equal to 18 perfect so now that we've read in the age input we can check if it's 18 let's just process a message in here says you are 18 and let's have a look and see if this works AB 18 now I press enter it says you are 18 but this is the problem with storing everything as a string and then trying to use it as if it was a number if I type in 18 followed by a space as you can see there's a blank Spacey now and press enter you can see that it doesn't come up and the reason why is it's processing it like this with a space at the end in order to avoid situations like this this is why we would convert it to a number and the reason why we're using equals to here is we can't use greater than or equal to because strings can't be greater than or equal to another string they can only ever be equal to or not equal to string is just text so if something equals to something then it's fine the only way that we can use these different operators is if we actually interact with our integer variable now let's see how we can use this so we can say age equals equals 18 and now you can see we actually reference it as a number now let's run the code if I do 18 Follow by space it still works and the reason why is it actually dismisses that space when it's converting to the integer so now age is stored as an integer and we can actually manipulate this a bit better so instead of saying you are 18 we can say you are 18 or Alo and now instead of doing equal to we can have greater than if we have greater than then we're actually dismissing the number 18 because if the age is greater than 18 so this will read like this and 18 is not greater than 18 so this will return back false what we actually want to use is greater than or equal to if the age that we've inputed is greater than or equal to 18 then you are 18 hence the equal to or greater than if you're older so now let's try and run this abber 23 perfect you are 18 or older let's change so let's change some other if statements to add some additional conditions so we can say else if and the only reason why it would come into this bracket if this condition returns false it will move down the next condition in the else chain if this was wrote as a separate if statement then this would run completely independently from this one if you're going to have chained if statements you need to make sure that you chain them correctly in this case I want to check if it ages between 18 and 25 and then move on to a different age bracket and these two things are grouped together so we should have this as an else if because with an age bracket you can only be part of one age bracket and not multiple so we can say if age is greater than or equal to 25 and we can copy this and we can say you are 25 or older now let's see what happens enter your name abber and let's just say that I am 35 it says you're 18 or older but I told it the program I was 35 now the problem we're facing is any value that's over 18 will always enter inside here and it will skip over this one completely this is not the behavior it that we want so what we can do in our if statements is we can use the double pipe which represents or or the double Ampersand which represents and and we can change some conditions in here to make sure that you implement some sort of range so we can actually have a range between 18 and 25 so we can say if the age is greater than or equal to 18 and the age is less than or equal to 25 and we can tweak this message you are between 18 and 25 and let's just run that for now and see what happens ABA 25 now it says 18 and 25 so now that we've got between 18 and 25 here we can tweak this to be greater than or equal to 26 if you're 25 will'll enter this condition and if you're 26 or older into this condition so let's test that now if we enter 35 now it says you're 26 or older that's perfect because now that we've implemented range checking it gives us the ability differentiate between different age groups more precisely let's Show an example of how to use the all so if we just have a block comment around all of this we can write an if statement in here and we can say if the edge is smaller than zero or the edge is bigger than 150 then we can output to the screen inv valid Edge and what this is saying is if we're less than zero and notice that this is less than zero so this value will actually start at minus one and this value start at 150 is minus one or less or over 150 then this will happen notice why it's an r one of these need to be true in order for this to be true when you've got an and both sides need to be true in order for this condition to evaluate is true so let's try our code we can say and we put minus one one and now it says invalid age which is perfect because this is our range checking and we can try again with 151 as it's just outside the range it will say invalid age and if we have an else on here we can print valid Edge notice there is no condition in here if you have an open else like this it means If This Were to return false it will always do this regardless of any condition in this case is it's perfectly reasonable to do this because we know that any values that are underneath zero or over 150 is invalid and anything between 0 and 150 is indeed valid what you can do instead is actually move these if statements inside here so instead of just printing out valid age we can actually check the age as well so let's run this now and we can say Aba minus one and it will only print out invalid age and then move on because once it reads this line of codee it will actually skip over the lse and finish up down here and now if you enter a real value you are between 18 and 25 so let's follow the path it got to here and realize that the range track was actually correct so it jumped out of this curly brace and went to the else because this had returned false we jump into this else and now we start checking if age is between 18 and 25 which it was because our age variable is 23 then it outputed this to the screen now if we do the same thing but have 35 instead then it follows the exact same path except towards here this will return back false and then it will check the next condition if age is over 26 then we'll return this so now let's just make a quick multiplication program using if statement to see if you can get the answer correct so let's just comment everything out and we'll start the next section underneath so let's make a console. write and ask the user to enter the first number and then we can say int number a equals convert to int32 and the value that we want to convert is a console. readline which is whatever the users entered from the console again if you're unfamiliar with this format you can just type it in manually number a input equals console readline and then we can put the number input in here now if you use shift and highlight these lines and press contrl D we can duplicate this entire section and we can say enter the second number change a to B change a to B and then finally change a to B perfect so now we've got into the first number and enter the second number and we can say our answer equal to number a multip by number B and then we can have a console. right value of you can add to it number A plus an X Plus number B and then finally plus a callon for the user to type in and then we can say string answer input equals console. readline and then int actual answer equals convert to in 32 and then we can have the input in here so now that we've got one number from the console the second number from the console we're just making a variable that will multiply them together and store inside answer and then we're just going to ask the user what's the value of number a times my number B and they can input that we store it as a string and then convert it to an integer and store the answer into actual answer so now just after the section we can write an if statement that says if the answer equals to the actual answer then we can say Well done and else and the reason why we don't need a condition this else because with equals to the only opposite thing you can have is if it's not equal to so if you really wanted to you could also right if answer is not equal to actual answer then in here you can say close but it was wrong you don't actually need this this is just for learning purposes because this will return back false if they're not equal to each other so this statement is just a given if they're not equal to each other then we can just assume that they're not equal to each other so so we don't need this additional statement if this condition evaluates to being false then that means they're not equal to each other we don't need this additional check to check if they're not equal to each other because that's a given if this returns back false so we can just leave this as an else let's try run the code 10 10 value of 10 * 10 100 now it says well done and let's just try that again and we can enter a different value 90 Clause but it was wrong so let's just have a quick recap so in the previous section we talked about how to input from the console and we generated this line of code which will output your name and your age in one line to the console and then we looked at how we can use these different operators in our if statements and we did some range checking to check if the age was between 18 and 25 and it would output something to the screen and if it was over 26 you'd get a different output to the screen and then we took that a little bit further and started using the r operator if the age is smaller than zero or it's greater than 150 then it must be invalid and if this condition returns false it must be between 0 and 150 so we can come into this L's bracket and inside here we can do our range checkin from the previous bit of code we can check the ranges between 180 and 25 and print a value or if it's over 26 we can print another value and you can keep changing these if you want you can have 26 to 40 and 40 to 60 etc etc that's up to you so this is just a quick little program to simulate multiplication program we can enter the first number using console. right and then we start it as a string and we put that string into the convert in 32 function to give us back an integer variable and we do exactly the same thing for the second number and then we make a variable to store both numbers multiplied by each other we ask the user what is the value of number a Times by number B and we give them an opportunity to type in a value we read that value in convert it to an integer store it as an into actual answer and then in our if statement we say if the answer is equal to the actual answer then we print well done to the screen double equals are used for equality and single equals are used for assignment don't get them mixed up we don't need an else condition in here because if this returns true then this will execute if this is indeed false that they're not equal to each other then we always want to do this section and we don't need to put an additional if statement inside here if you wanted to but it's not necessary you can have else if answer is not equal to actual answer but this is just extra code and it hurts the readability and it should be avoided if statements are one of the methods we can decide different paths in our code the next method we can use is called switch statements so let's write a little program so we can demonstrate this so we can just have a console. right enter a date of the week and we can have in date equals convert to in32 and we can place our console. readline inside the brackets so we take whatever the user typed into the console and then place it inside here and inside here we're going to convert whatever they've typed in to an integer 32 and star it into our D variable so if we just print this out to the screen to make sure it's working fine if we just type in seven we can see that seven is returned so it's all working so normally what we do is type if D equals equals 1 and then we can add the curly braces and use CW tab tab and we can print out Monday now if you run the code and try use number one then Monday works and that's fine and then let's do another lse if and we can say day equals equals 2 and then we can print Tuesday perfect so if we try that now there we go so now we have the ability to print out Monday and choose it to the console depending what day the week the user enters but since we're going to have seven different paths because we got seven days of the week then sometimes it might be better and cleaner to use a switch statement so let's have a look at the syntax so we can type in switch and then inside the brackets it's what variable we want to have a switch on so in this case we want to be using the day variable so we can add day in the brackets this is not a condition in the brackets this is just telling us what variable we're going to be using for the switch statement so let's open the curly braces after and inside here instead of having paths like this we're going to use cases so this can be translated to in the case of number one we can do this in the case of number two we can do this so let's try and see how it works we can type in case followed by number one and then add a call on and then we can type out our Monday in here and then we need to follow each case off by finishing the section off with a break this break is very essential and you'll get a syntax error if you don't put it in so now if we do case two and we do exactly the same thing there we go and if I dismiss the break then you'll realize that it says it cannot fall out so we have to use a break just the compiler knows that we want to break here the reason why this break is placed inside here is because what we can do is we can say case two and then add another one in here called case three and what this now reads is if we enter two it says Tuesday and if we enter three It also says choose it so what you can do is you can actually chain so this would be equivalent to writing if D equals 2 or D equal equals 3 now this is exact translation these two are exactly the same as of right now we have D equals equals 1 which is our case 1 and then equals 2 or equals 3 is right here if we go into the case 2 path it will fall in the case 3 so we're saying for this break is we want to end this section here so now if we just revert this back and continue the chain I'll just skip this part just so it's a little bit quick there we go so now that we've got all seven days of the week let's just see if it works let's try six and we have sat it so now we're kind of missing something from here the only thing we're missing is having our external else just in case the user types something invalid so normally we would write something like this enter value between 1 and 7 just to make sure that the user knows what they're doing now we don't seem to have anything inside here that gives us the opportunity to it in invalid so we have this keyword called default and it works exactly the same as the case except what this will do is this is basically the word that replaces else so we can literally take this line of code and place it again over here and add ourselves a break this is exactly the same as doing our L statement inside here if none of these cases match this variable then it'll go into the default and continue as normal so if we type in zero we should see the message twice because it's executing for the if statement and executing down here and let's do eight and you see the message again so now that the case statement is fully working let's just comment out the if statement and make sure that it's still works one Monday let's just try another one and we can do seven for Sunday so just a quick recap case statements are used by using the keyword switch followed by the variable in question and then if you want to check if this variable number is equal to something you put that something straight after the word case followed by a colon and then you can insert multiple lines of code inside here and make sure you end that line with a break if you want to chair in multiple like Dayal 2 or Dayal 3 then you can add the case above right here so the case of zero or the case of two it will do this little section so it'll print out choose there if the user enters zero or the user enters two of course in this case we don't actually want that after you filled out all of the code make sure you add something called the default the default is equivalent to an lse keyword in our if statement just to catch all the Val use in case the users type something incorrect and you want to let them know what they should be typing instead so now that we explored different paths in our code using IF statements and switch statements let's have a look at how we can iterate through our code an iteration in code is just the ability to be able to Loop and do a certain task so let's say we wanted to print high to the console several times then we just have to copy and paste it down and this will be five separate lines that do exactly the same thing this will essentially achieve what we want the problem is you just have exactly the same code copy and pasted so what we can do if we just block comment this line for the time being we can write something called a for Loop a for Loop gives us the ability to Loop a certain amount of times depending on the parameters that we give it so this is the syntax you can type for open the bracket and we have to use a variable so we can declare a new variable straight into these brackets we can say in I equals z and then have a semicolon and there's three different sections of this the first one is the variable decoration and initialization and the second one is the condition so in this case we want to do this task five times so you want to say I is less than five then we end that semicolon there and now for the third task every time this fall Loop goes around we want to increase I by one because we want to go in steps of one so we can do i++ alternative if you don't like using Plus+ you can say I = I + 1 or to make that quicker you can could say i+ equals 1 I personally just prefer using Plus+ and you'll see that everywhere else there is certain cases where you would actually you want to change this to a different value like i+ equal 2 and we'll show you that in a second so this for Loop now says we want to go from ials Z and once this condition returns back false when I is equal to 5 or greater then we want to stop this for Loop every time this forp goes around so when it hits this curly brace and comes back around we want to do this action and in this this case it's I ++ so if we just use console right line and print out the value I we can see what happens when the follow runs you can see that the value of I is increasing one each time and after the fifth time is increased the value is actually five so now this statement is false because the value of I is equal to five so therefore this is now false and the fall Loop is ended so now that we've verified that you can repeat it five times using this code we no longer want to print I we want to print our high so let's paste that inside the bracket and run the code now you can see that these two values will be exactly the same as printing it out to the console just like this but now we have a lot less code so let's have a look at another example we can say 4 in I equal 0 and we can say I is less than or equal to 10 and then we can do i+ equal 2 and then if we just print I to the console so what this is now saying is I want to go from zero all the way till 10 and I want to go up two times each time so what this will be achieving is printing out all of the even numbers between 0 and 10 let's try and run it now we can see we have all the even numbers printed out between 0 and 10 because we're going up in twos if we start this at one for example and still keep every parameter exactly the same then we'll be getting all of the even numbers between 1 and 10 11 is missing because our condition stops at less than or equal to 10 what you can also do with for Loops is you can let the user determine what this value is going to be let's test that so if we block comment this section out what we can do is we can append this little section so we can have a console. right how many times do you want to say hi can have a callon followed by speech marks and then we can say int Loop counter equals convert to n32 and we can have console read line inside the brackets how many times you want to say hi the user types in the value we take the console read line as a string convert it to an integer and St inside loop counter so now what needs to change inside here the five is what determines how many times that we're going to Loop so in this case we actually want to just Loop by whatever the user types in the counter let's just type five and make sure it works and if we just type one it works if we type zero however however it will just skip over the for Loop and the reason for that is if you're going from zero to I is less than zero then this is immediately going to be false so then the for Loop is just going to get skipped immediately there is nothing to do if the user is typed in zero which is perfectly reasonable and you can type in a really big number like a 100 and it will output them all to the screen if the user types in zero then nothing's going to come up so you always want to be able to let the user know if there's something wrong so we can say if the loop counter equals equals to zero or maybe we can change this to less than or equal to cuz it could type in minus numbers as well we could just say conso right line using CW tab tab sorry please enter a value above zero and then if this condition has returned back false then inside our else statement we don't need to give it an else if because if it's less than or equal to zero then we want to process the other values because it has to be greater or equal to one so when this is false this section has to be greater than or equal to one so we can just place our for Loop inside here and that's fine and let's try to run the code now and if we type in zero please enter a value of zero and if we just try any negative values we'll get the same message if you want to print additional code in here you can literally do anything you want you can even ask the user what they want to print up here and then you can replace this with a message for example we can have a string message and we can just change this to hello world and this could be something that you read in from the console so we can say message and we can put that in here and if we print that there we go so we can just say console. right what do you want to repeat and then we can read this in and actually it might be easier if we change this Loop counter to Second so if we highlight the section and hold alt and press down arrow twice we can move it down and say and how many times do you want to repeat it there we go so now what we can do is we can use this message inside here and then Loop depending on how many times the users typed in whatever so we can type in hello world get this exact value and we can say 10 times there we go so now this entire program is fully customized by the user's input so let's just have a quick recap so we started off this code by printing the console right line five times to the screen we wrote Our simple far Loop that went from in equal Zer to I is less than 5 and we did I ++ because we want to count up in ones you can place the high inside here and it'll printed it five times for us so now we've made our code from five lines down to just three lines for the for Loop and then we allowed the user to type in how many times that they want to repeat it and we change the condition from I is less than five to I is less than whatever the user has typed in installed within the loop counter and then we hit a problem where if we entered zero anything less than zero the F would just not run and it might look like some things went wrong so we added a little if statement in here to make sure that the user has entered a value above zero and if they haven't we can let them know we don't need another if statement in here because if this has returned back false we can assume that the value is something that we can work with we later tailored the program so we can change this message that was fixed to high to something that the user can type in manually so now that we know how to use for Loops let's have a look at while Loops for loops and while Loops still iterate through code but they're used in slightly different contexts for Loops are used mainly when you know how many times you can iterate through as in this example we're going to printer the console exactly 10 times but in a y Loop you might print until a condition is true for example if you asking the user to type a number and they kept typing in something else you don't know how many times it's going to take the user to type in correctly so in that case you would use a y Loop if you executing a certain amount of code and you're only doing it a fixed amount of times then it's always best to use a for Loop so first let's try and convert this simple for Loop that just prints I to the console 10 times just like so from zero all the way till 9 so let's comment out this for Loop and have a look at this Syntax for the while loop so we can type the world while and then in here we have our condition and then we can open our curly braces and while this condition returns back true it will always go inside the curly braces and when this condition returns back false then we'll exit the while loop so let's try and mimic exactly what we're doing inside here there's three sections of the for Loop we Define the variable that we're going to use for the for Loop counter and we give it an initial value we give it the stop dring condition and we give it how many times the value needs to go up every time the fall Loop iterates in the while loop situation we only have the condition available so let's take our condition and paste it straight into here and now we need to store our variable so just because it's a while loop when we can't store it inside here we have to do it outside the Y Loop so let's make it in I and we'll make it equal to zero so we've got our variable we've got our condition now we need to set I ++ so inside the Y Loop we can say i++ and then now we've achieved this entire line and successfully converted it let's try and put the console right line in and see what happens and let's run the code so it's going from 1 all the way till 10 and the reason why it's gone from 1 till 10 not from 0 to 10 is because the i++ is at the start let's move it down online using alt and down arrow key to move it down and let's run it again and you can see it goes from 0 to 99 and if we just block comment this out and undo the for Loop you can see that they're doing exactly the same thing so let's bring the W loop back and as you can see what we have is we've defined our I variable made it equals to zero while the I variable is less than the value of 10 we print the I to the console and increment I by one and we keep looping this until this statement returns back false and then exit the Y Loop and jump underneath the curly braces and hit the console read line and this is the output that we've got so now I've just copied the code from the if statement video and let's make this code a little bit better so let's comment out our while loop and our for Loop that was just used for explanation purposes and this is the code that you saw earlier on in the C we read in the first number start as a string use that string to convert to an integer star number a and Then star number B and these two blocks are exactly the same except you have have enter first number and enter second number and we store number a and store number B then we store the value of them both multiplied inside our int answer variable then we ask the user what's the value of both answers times together give them a chance to input their value convert it to an integer and then we check the value and print well done of close but it was wrong now if we run this code again and we type in 10 and 10 and we know the values of 100 but let's just type in 90 now this is kind of a problematic user case we've asked the user to type in a value and they've got it wrong and then when they press enter the program just closes there's no opportunity to Loop or try this again so what we can do is add a y Loop in here and we can say while the answer is incorrect we can keep asking the user to keep on guessing so instead of reading the input here let's turn this little section into a question what's the value of number a * number B and instead of allowing an input here let's just put a question mark and then let's add a console right line just to give a little bit of a gap and then in order to do our while loop we actually want to create a bolean variable just to track if the answer has been correct or not this is the section that we want to loop around in the while loop we want to read in the user's answer check it output a message and then give them the opportunity to read in another value so they can guess again while the answer is not not equal to the actual answer then we can loop around our code so we have to modify a few things here so we can't just take this code and place it inside the problem with doing this is the variables that we want to check answer is outside of this y Loop but actual answer is inside and the reason why there's a red line here says it does not exist in the current context because we're trying to check a variable that hasn't been defined yet so what we can do is take the decoration for the actual answer and place it outside here and make make it equal to zero and instead of redeclaring it inside the while loop we can take this in and get rid of it so we set the actual answers to zero set the answer to the multiplication while the answer is not equal to the actual answer then we want to loop around so we don't actually need another check in here this while loop will keep on repeating if the answer is incorrect so we don't need a path for correct and incorrect if this while loop still continues then the answer will always be incorrect so what we can do to double check is we can say if the answer does not equal the actual answer then we can place this message inside here and get rid of this branch and then after the while loop has continued we can say Well done so let's just read through the code while the answer is not equal to the actual answer and when this while loop first enters it's going to be true because you're going to have 10 * 10 which is 100 and the value of answer is zero so this will return back true cuz these two values are not equal to each other then we're going to ask the user to enter the value then we're going to read into the actual answer check if they're not equal to each other and then we output a message because we're asking a question here we want to ask another one using a console right Line enter your answer call on here we go so let's have a look and see how this works 100 100 what's the value of 100 * 100 and let's just get it wrong on purpose 90 call is wrong and now we get to answer again and we can keep answering this as many times as we want until we reach the correct answer which in this case is 10,000 and we've got the answer well done so to make the console look a little bit better cuz this is all in one block we can separate these with console right lines maybe after this line we can print out a new line and then after each guess we can print out another new line so after each guess we'll be down here we can just print out a blank console right line and just after after you ask them to enter the second number we can print another one here and let's just see how that looks 10 10 now it looks a lot better because you ask the user to input the numbers then you ask them the question and then you get the answer and then it keeps looping around like this so there's a little gap between each one so you can efficiently read it instead of it all being closed off together and now if you answer it correctly 100 now it says well done and when we press enter again the program now closes so that was using a while loop and now we have something else called a do while and a do while is very close to a while except that the while will only happen if this condition returns back true and a do while will always happen once and it'll check the condition at the end so let's have a look and see how this works so we write the word do and then we have the curly braces and then after it we have our while condition and let's just copy the condition from the old while loop and we can say answer is not equal to actual answer so as you can see with a while loop it will always check the condition first and then it opens the curly braces in the do there is no condition it will always do everything inside the curly braces once and then it will check this while condition if this condition is still true then it'll loop around and check it every time but it will only check it at the end while Loops will check the condition as the first thing it does and then check it every iteration so let's move our Corde down into here and let's just comment out our while loop just to see how this works and if we run it again to make sure it's working fine 10 10 90 90 50 and then finally 100 and it says well done so you could be thinking what are the differences between a while loop and a do while in certain cases you want the while loop to make sure this condition is true before even continuing in this specific case we always want the user to answer the question it doesn't matter if it executes once because actually that's the behavior that we want we've asked the user a question right here so we want to always be looping at least one time the while loop user case doesn't quite apply here because we don't necessarily have to check if they've answered correctly if they haven't even inputed a value yet we always want to be able to give them the option to do it once and then we check their answer at the end they could get it on the first answer 10 10 100 and it'll still be fine the same is true with a while loop but it'll B easier and it makes more sense to read your code when you have a while loop you can see that this bit of code depends on a condition whereas in a due while the first iteration does not depend on anything but the second and third and so forth depend on the condition so depending on your user case and what situation you want to use it you should either pick a while loop which will only occur through a condition or pick a do while that will occur once or multiple times after the first condition has passed so when you have if statements that are pretty basic you can actually make them quite easy to read through the conditional operator also known as the Turner operator so let's see how this works let's say we have an INT ede and we set it to a minus value and we know that this value can never be someone's age because it's negative but let's say that we have a situation where you ask the use it for their age and they've accidentally typed in -10 and we know that that value is not actually true so we could write something like this age is greater than or equal to zero then we can print out valid and then in the lse we can take this console right line and we can print out invalid so that means if we run our code now you can see that it says invalid and if we change it to positive 10 now it says valid so this seems a little bit long we are just checking one condition printing a value and printing another value if that condition returns back false so our conditional operator works like this we have a condition followed by question mark then the value if it returns true then the value if it returns false let's see how you can rewrite this if statement into one simple line so let's take this in steps these two values are both strings that we've typed in so let's make a string and we can call it result and let's make it equal to our Turner operator so the first step is to get the condition and the condition in this case if the age is greater than equal to zero we can follow that by a question mark and then if this returns back true we want the string to say valid and we can have a call on and if it returns back false then we want the string to say invalid and we can add a semicolon and then straight after it we can just have a console right line that just says result as you can see now that we get it twice we can verify one comes from the if statement and one comes from from the turny operator and now if we make this a positive 10 then you can see it both says valid so if we comment out the if statement and just see this running on its own just to double check there we go and because this is just returning back a string we can actually just take all of this code in the conditional operator and paste it straight into the console right line so you run the line of code now we get exactly the same thing if this hurts the readability of your code then it's best to just store it and then use it after if you can read this code and it's better for you in the long run later on you might want to dismiss this variable and do it straight inside the brackets just to save a variable and then print it out to the screen straight away it'll be better for memory if you just print it out straight away but if you're not familiar with this notation yet and you want to get used to it then that's fine as well so a quick recap we had an if statement with a condition and if this returned back true we printed valid and if it return back false we print invalid and this is pretty simple the only difference between these two paths is this string literal that we've typed into here so we can pull the string values out and place them in our conditional operator we can say string result is equal to if the age is greater than or equal to zero then we store valid inside result and if it's not greater than equal to zero then we can start inv valid straighten our string after we've start this value we can print results straight to the screen which will either give us valid or invalid when you're dividing two numbers you might get an ugly output just like this the user sometimes doesn't want to see such long decimal places and maybe you just want to prevent it to 81.3 in order to do this we need to use a format pattern so the language understands what we're trying to achieve so if we make another console right line what we can do is use string. format and inside the brackets we can give it a format and then the object that we want to format so in this case the object in the second parameter is our value so let's open some speech marks go to the next parameter using the comma and just type in our value and then inside the speech marks we want to type in the pattern if you type in curly brace as zero then zero represents the first value in this list we can do a space followed by curly braces one and then add another comma and we can add a thousand and what this means is value will get placed where zero is and 1,000 will get Place one is so let's run this and you see the exact same thing's happened plus a SP and now we have the Thousand which follows this part exactly if this is confusing don't worry too much about it I have the next section all about string functions so let's get rid of the one followed by the thousand and run it again and we should see the output being exactly the same there we go so now let's see how we can make this better in terms of decimal places so just after the zero and the zero represents the first value value we can add a callon and this callon will tell us what format we want the value to be displayed as we can type in 0. and what this means is all the numbers before the decimal place will get displayed and only two numbers after the decimal place will get displayed so let's try run this now and you can see that the code output is a lot cleaner one thing to note though by default this will round it up 0.37 becomes 0.4 not to worry though cuz this is what the user will see on the screen and it won't affect the actual value of the variable if we print out value straight after you'll see that the difference hasn't been changed it's still 0.3 in the original variable so that's one method of doing it what we can do now is just use contr D and copy it down and we can use different formats to show you what it looks like if we remove the 0 and then one of the zeros and leave it like this and it grains one decimal place each time you'll see what the output looks like we just have the 81 which essentially makes it into an integer because it's a whole number then we have 81.0 and the reason why it's 0 Z is cuz 0.3 will round down as it's under 0.5 the 03 is going to round down as it's under 05 so it'll round down to zero and then finally we have the 81.4 and just like before this will round down to4 and just like before this will round down to 0.4 this will round down to 04 let's say you wanted to get rid of trailing zeros because you don't want them then you can actually change this zero to a hashtag once you onun the hashtag then it will trim off any trailing zeros so what this means is it will try and put it in this format but if this format happens to be a zero then it will just keep it like this and if you just have 81 dot then it'll also get rid of the dot for you so then you just left with 81 it's really up to you as the programmer what you want want to display depending on what context I'm just giving you the options that you have available so let's say we want to work with money now and we have a 10d divided by 3D and what that value would be is somewhere between 3333 and this will be reoccurring cuz it's exactly 1/3 the reason why I've got D's in here is because these are registering as doubles if you type the value in normally it'll get registers an in32 and the problem with in32 is when you do this division it will process the division is an integer and then store it as a double the issue with that is in this case and in this case both values will get truned let me demonstrate if I remove the D from both sides and down in here it will see what the difference is and let's print out money and then's see what's happened in the first case this isn't actually an issue because we have a decimal place here which means this will be a double so an integer divided by double will give us a double but we just place the D here just so we don't forget and and it makes the compiler's job a lot easier cuz it doesn't have to convert it from an integer to a double and in this case we have an INT that's divided by an INT so we'll get 3.3 reoccurring but because it's processing as an integer then we just get three being displayed and this is not the intended result so let's just replace these back to D's and we'll see what we get now which is a 3.3 perfect so let's say that we want to display this as actual currency because you never see it displayed like this it's always to two decimal places just as follows so we can follow the same approach as above we can do string. format 0 call on 0.00 and the curly brace and then common money cuz that's the variable in reference and now if we run that let's see what happens 3.33 that's perfect and now what we can do in here because this is the pattern we can actually type in anything before after this and it won't affect the pattern just like so we've added some Extra Spaces in here so if we get rid of these spaces we can actually just place a pound sign in front of it and then let's see what happens when we run it perfect so now we actually have some money and we can say in here £10 /3 equals this and now our output looks a little bit better because we have some formatting now the issue is when we start getting into negatives let's see what happens so we can say -10 /3 equals something and when we run we'll see that the format is actually incorrect now you never see the negative symbol after the pound symbol it's always this way around in this case what we're doing is we're telling the compiler hey we only want to see two decimal places but always keep in this format the pound sign followed by the value and the value of money is -3 so it'll Place -3 inside here and then add the pound sign before it but we don't don't exactly want that so we can add something called a culture info but we can also give it some other formatting some other way so let's explore some other options if you use money to string then what we're actually doing here is using the double variable and converting it to a string and we get passed back a string representative of this value and that's fine and when we run the code you'll see no difference between these two at this point they're both being converted to Strings but what we can do in this case is when we open these brackets it tells us there one of four what does this mean exactly so in our two string function we have four ways that we can call this function the first way you give nothing in the brackets and if we press the down arrow the second way is to give it a format provider the Third Way is just a string format and the fourth way is both a format and a provider so we'll use all of these in a second but let's explore the easiest one if you add a string in there which gives us the third overload string format and we can just type in a Capital C let's just see what happens perfect so now we have the best format displayed to us and the reason why this works is the C program will recognize that the format of C is telling us that we want to display currency so then it's going to your local machine and figuring out where you are based on your date and time just down here when you have adjust date and time it will figure it out based on this we have UTC time and we have the date and time listed up here based on that information it can figure out that we are indeed in the UK and we want to display a pound sign and because the program knows that it's - 3.33 it'll put the pound sign in the right location so now that we've explored C let's have a look at the other ones that are available so if we use contrl D and copy this down three times we can use C 0 C1 and C2 and now if you run this again you'll see what the output gets you c will get your currency in its most native form which is what we're used to using in the UK C zero will only return you back with the whole number C1 will give you one decimal place and C2 mimics C on its own as they're displaying the same values now this is where it gets interesting if you want to display a different currencies then you're going to have to use this thing called a culture info which will be able to retrieve back different currency formats based on a certain country code that you give the function so let's have a look and see how that works if we scroll to the top we can add a new library called system. globalization inside globalization we have a culture info so let's see how we can tailor these to make it look a lot better if you're worried about different currencies so we use CW tab tab and we do the same thing money. two string we add our C and this is where our format provider fits in so we can start typing culture info it should come up like this press enter and inside this is a class that's why it went green if we press dot then we get the current culture the current culture will decide based on the machine that the program is running on if this program is running on a cloud computer and the cloud computer is stored in Europe then it might display euros and if it's stored in America then it'll display dollars so you want to avoid using current culture if you're going to scale your program worldwide in the case of this example I'm going to leave it because as you you can see when I run it it will display the same thing as the other ones because this one will also recognize that my current culture is UK and I'm also telling it to use the current culture so in both of these cases it's figured out that my current culture is indeed the UK and it started using the pound sign but let's say we want to give it a different culture then what we can do if we duplicate this line using contr D and remove this section just after the dot we can actually say create specific culture and inside the parentheses we can actually add a string and it says here a predefined culture name or the name of an existing culture info object the name is not case sensitive so in the case of the UK you have English GB and now we need another bracket at the end and then if we use controll D to copy this down we can change GB to us let's run this again and see what happens these two don't actually output anything different because we're just doing the normal culture and then we're telling it to find the GB culture which is exactly the same thing for me so we get these two values exactly the same and apparently it's picking up that in the US you have brackets around your negative values which I can't personally validate but this is how it's showing up so let's try some other cultures and see what happens so we can try Au for Australian then you can see that they actually use a negative followed by the pound sign and then the value so even though they're both in dollars one's US Dollars and one Australian dollars and apparently the US uses brackets for the negative values but Australians use the negative value like we do so let's just have a quick recap so we can display the value just like this but we'll have a problem with multiple decimal places we can use these former options to give us zero decimal places one or two decimal places and then when we use this format the problem with it was when you display negative numbers you get a nasty form format where the negative value actually comes after the pound sign which is not correct and you don't want to Output that to your users instead you should use the C format to tell the compiler that you want to process this as a currency currency processing is better because the software will understand that the value you're trying to represent depends on a certain strict format just as follows you don't want the negative to be here instead of before it because that doesn't look very nice to the end user alternatively you could use this CI info if you're going to scale your program scaling your program means that it's going to live on servers and this culture in for especially the current culture depends on where the program is being run on because it depends on the system time different servers will have different dat times set because they'll be in different countries so you want to be careful and if you want to display in a certain currency you can create a culture specification and pass the country code inside the brackets and then you'll get the correct output and it doesn't matter where your program lives if you always want to generate in pound symbols then you always use create specific culture and always specify NGB upon doing so you'll always get the pound sign and it doesn't matter where your program lives so throughout this course you've seen this notation a lot print out value using console right to give the user an opportunity to write on the same line reading their value as a string and store it in a variable and then use that variable able to convert it to an integer 32 and we're passing the string input inside here and then we convert it to an integer if we run the code you can see that this actually works perfectly assuming you actually enter a real number like 10 we press enter and it works and it outputs back to the screen using this console right line and if you press this restart button we can start the program again and let's say we accidentally type a character like L and we press enter and we've get a format exception now this is problematic because our program will now close if we press continue it doesn't even hit this line or this as soon as it hits the exception in here our program just closes if we use debug start with our debugging and now we're actually running the program outside of visual studio so we won't get that pop up when the error happens let's see what happens if we type this in now we can say 10p and press enter and now we get that the program stopped working you've probably seen this pop up a lot throughout Windows and different versions of Windows because when a program has a fair little error or an exception you see this popup appear and the only thing you can do is either debug or close it normally the debug option isn't available but because this is a c program and it's made through Visual Studio and the visual studio is being installed on the system then it gives us the option but really all we can do here is just terminate the program it doesn't matter what happened because we can't recover this if we press close then it's literally just going to close down it's going to tell us the exception and then press any key to continue and it's as you press any key then the program just closes so this is very fatal for our code since if we had some precious data stored in here or anywhere else in the program it is now lost before we can do anything this is problematic and we want to avoid this the best way to do this is to use something called trass right here the program is assuming that your string input is a perfect input and then you're immediately converting it to an integer now like I said what if this had 10 H in it the program is going to cause an exception and then the program is going to close so let's see what we can do with this trip pass function so the notation is int. trass the first parameter is a string s string s is a string containing a number to convert so what this tripassure equivalent a return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded okay perfect so we'll get into that in a second so our string s is a string containing our number to convert and in this case we want to be using the num input so we copy and paste that down and then we add a comma because we have more than one parameter now we have an out int result when this method returns result which is our integer contains the 32bit sign integer equivalent of the number contained in S and S in this case is our first parameter which is num input if the conversion succeeded then we get the value inside our result or zero if the conversion failed the conversion fails if the parameter s is null or string empty is not of the correct format or it represents a number that's less or more than the maximum value that the integer can stall this paramet is p uninitialized any value originally supplies in result will be overwritten let's dive in to see what this means because it's an out in result what this means is we can actually process a variable inside here like in Num so we can say out num and what this will do is when this line executes it will try and convert num input and place the value inside num so we don't need to run this convert anymore we can just specify that num is equal to zero so we've read in the string that contains our 10 H and we have our num that contains zero let's just remove this console right line so now we have our variable set up let's see what happens if we do a conso right line and just print num after this let's see what happens to the code so if we type in 10 H and press enter the value of num is zero but what you notice now the program hasn't caused because it's tried to pass it instead of just passing it automatically and then cause an exception so the reason why Try pass is called try pass is first it tries and then if it succeeds this will contain the value and if it doesn't succeed this will contain zero to know if the number has actually been converted we actually have to use the bull return value so what this means is because it returns us back a bull we can store it inside a bull and we can give it the name of success bull success equals into. trass we try and pass the num input and we place the value inside num the reason why having this bu success is very very essential let's say for example the user actually enters zero so technically as of this point num zero is actually correct because we've got zero and we initialize it to zero but of course after the trass runs this is still going to be zero now we don't know if the value zero is because this has succeeded or the value is zero because we initialized it to zero let me demonstrate if I type in a zero here is this zero being converted because this was successful or is it presenting me zero because this has been initialized to zero and the only way we can know is because our trip pass will return us back with true if s was converted successfully otherwise false we can actually write an if statement in here if success open the curly braces and we can start to type something in here so we can take our console right line and place it up here using alt and up Arrow key and then in the L's we can say failed to convert so now we have a mini setup here if it's been successful we print out the number if it hasn't been successful then it'll go into this path and it'll print fail to convert let's have a look and see how this works now if I press zero and I see Zero that means it's followed down the success path and this zero actually means it's converted my input instead of just the value that it's being initialized by if you run the code again and type in 10 hit then we actually see it says fail to convert and why that happened is we have 10 H appear and then this will return back false when it tries to convert num input and then after it hits this line since success will be false it will Dodge this path going into this path and output fail to convert what you can do if you really wanted to is you could wrap this around in a while loop so let's see what we can do so we can specify a bu's success and make that equal to true and then we can add a while loop with success in there and then open the curly braces and put all of this code inside here now we're going to have some errors because we got success twice but what we can do which will be a lot easier is we can place this straight inside our bracket and the reason why is because this returns us back at Boolean so we don't need to store it and then use it another thing we can do is instead of having Inn and then num right here you can actually make this a declaration as well so if we just remove this value we can write out Inn and this will do exactly the same thing it just uses less variables while our success is true we come into here and run this code if we fail to convert then we still want it to be true so we can loop around if we've converted it and the value is successful then we can actually make our success at this point false cuz that will stop the W loop from going around let's run the code we can type typ in 10 H 10 a 10 a etc etc and as soon as we type in a real number then it'll print out and the while loop will cancel and now right here we're set on the console readline now if we press enter the program will close so let's have a recap we use in. TR pass so we can try and pass a value before the program assumes that the value is in the correct format we give it a string variable and it returns us back with a fresh new integer called called num or whatever you want to call it inside here we can place this straight inside the condition of an if statement because this function returns us back with a true or false value otherwise known as a bull if this has been successful we stop the while loop and print the value out to the screen and if it hasn't been successful then we print fail to convert and because our success is still true it will L back around to the start of the while loop and ask the user to input another value to try and convert this Loop will only exit if it's indeed being successful and the only way it can exit is by having the success being equal to false and the only way that can happen is by having a successful conversion the use of trip pass in every program is very essential because if you have a fatal exception then your program will close and you will lose all the data the problem with that is you might lose anything that you haven't processed yet at that given point in your program so you want to try and use trass because you'll avoid any potential exceptions and you can let the user know if the conversion has been successful or not and write yourself the same while loop just like this so you can tell the user hey you input it incorrectly but this is how to do it right and make sure that your program doesn't execute incorrectly and make sure your program doesn't just close unexpectedly and then an error will be caused in this exercise I want you to print out some sort of times table and what I mean by this is you want to ask the user us to input a number for the table and then write a for Loop to print out the x * table X is dependent on the value that entered if they enter 10 in here then this will be the 10 times table let's get started so we can have our normal console. write enter a number and then use our int number equals to convert to in32 and we can say console. readline because we want to read whatever the user types in then we have a four into I equal 0 I is less than 10 we're only going to print up to the 10 times table so 1 * Something 2 * something all the way up to 10 times the value that they entered immediately we acknowledge an error here when you do your 10times table for example you do 1 * 10 2 * 10 and so on and so forth the issue here is we're going from 0 to 10 but because it's less than 10 we're actually going from 0 to 9 so let changes to one and then less than or equal to 10 in both cases we were actually looping the same amount of times the issue is this was starting on one and the other one was starting on zero and the first one was finishing on nine and this one's finishing on 10 and we want them to go from 1 till 10 instead of from 0 till 9 even though that's the same amount of iterations it gives us different values so in here we can just have a console right line and this is how it's going to work work we're going to have our first number times by our second number and that's going to be equal to something so our first number is our value of I cuz that will say 1 time something 2 * something and so forth our second number is whatever the user has typed into the calculation which will be number and our third number is going to be the actual result of the calculation which are these two times together so we can have I star number and that should be it let's run it and give it a shot we can do our 10 times table and if we press enter you can see that it's fully working this will be our I variable going down the side the second number is what the user typed in and the third number is this multiplied by this gives you the output let's run it again with a bigger number and it seems to handle okay and because this is an integer you'll expect to work okay up until around 2.1 billion which is a big number for some times tables anyway so just a quick recap we Loop through from 1 till 10 instead of from 0 to 9 because we made sure that when we do our multiplications we don't want to start the value at 0 * something we want to start the first one at 1 time something and we don't want to end at N9 we want to end at 10 so using one and less than or equal to 10 will get us the values that go from 1 till 10 and that will make our output look a lot more concise we're using conditional format in here adding the zero and curly braces and then the one and then the two and in order to insert the values in it's a comma delimited list after the speech marks the first one goes in the right order zero is I one is number two is I times the number running that code we will get this output there you go so in this exercise I want you to have a look and see if you can make the Fizz bu game Fizz bu game is one of the most popular interview questions you'll come across and the way to do this is to create a for loop from one to something in this case I'm just going to use 15 and inside the followup you want to decide if the number is divisible by three and five then you want to print FS buuz if it's divisible by three then it's Fizz five it's buzz and if it doesn't fall into any of them categories then you want to simply just print the number out to the screen let's get started so we can have a four and because we know how many we want to do we want to do in I less than 15 I ++ and then inside here we need to use the modulus operator which is the percentage sign so if you remember from the tutorial in order to figure out if a number is odd or even you could do the number modul is two and if that value is one then it must mean it's odd and if that value is zero it must mean it's even but what we can also differentiate from here is if 10 modulus 2 equals 0 then that means that 10 is divisible by two but also it is even and if it's even that means it's divisible by two if it's not divisible by two that means it's not even and therefore it's odd so in this case if we try to divide three and five we can have the same calculation but we can work it out differently so 10 modulus 3 actually gives us a value of one because it's three remainder one so if this value is anything other than zero then we know that these two were not div divisible by each other 9 percentage 3 equals 0 which means it's divisible by it so in our if statement we can say if I which is the number that we're currently up to percentage 3 equals equals to zero and because we want to check for five as well we want to say and I percentage 5 equals equals to zero and that means they're both divisible by each other so we can do a console right line and we can say fiz buzz and then in else if we're going to check if it's three and we can repurpose this exact condition because this just checks if it's divisible by three and then we can print Fizz and then if we copy this exact structure down and change this to a five to check if it's divisible by five then we can print out buzz and in the worst case scenario where none of them get applied then we can simply print I to the screen and actually there's no point in starting at zero because normally these start at one so we'll just do one and we can make it 15 by making it less than or equal to so instead of before it was actually going from 0 to 14 now it's going from 1 to 15 and they will tell you this in the interview they might say counting from 1 to 100 print out all of the Fizz buzzers so let's run the code and see what's going on 1 2 fizz fizz is actually three so three is divisible by three then you have four and then five is divisible by five you get buzz and six goes into three so you get Fizz nine you get Fizz because it's divisible by three then 10 / by 5 gives you buzz 11 12 goes into three so you've got Fizz and finally when you hit 15 it goes into three and goes into five so we get Fizz buzz and the way to increase this to 100 is by simply changing this to 100 if you need to and you can scroll through the entire input and you can see all the history if you wanted to make this slightly efficient what you could actually do is store the booing values for these calculations before you can store the values for these calculations before so we can say Bo 3 div equals false and bull 5 div equals false and what we can do at the start of each of the for Loop is we can say three div equals this value and five div also equals this value and then every time we find a calculation for three or calculation for five we can replace it with either three div or five div so let's change this one here and this one here and our five here and here and because these are values now we want to actually store them as true or falses so we don't need to check if they're equal to zero so we can just remove them so we can say if three div and five div are both true and they'll only be true if these two are both zero now if we run the code and just make it 15 again just just we have a Shor output you can see that our code is exactly the same the reason why this is more efficient is we're only doing this calculation twice whereas before we were doing it twice for three and twice for five now we're doing it once storing it and then making use of it this is a lot more memory efficient than having to calculate it every single time it computes a lot faster and it's better for readability if the rules of the game happen to change and this was divisible by four or six then you could just change it very easily whereas in the previous example you would have to change it in every single case in C when you're constructing strings that have backslashes you're going to need to use double backslash and the reason for this is the first backslash is an indication that it's actually going to be an escape character you're going to put an escape character in and then put the character that you want to display and the reason for that is they've chose backslash as the designated character so so you can use backs slash and then a backs slash to show one backslash only and what this means is it will use the first backs slash as a reference so it knows that it's going to process the next character as an escape character I want these Escape characters are you can have things like T for tab n for new line and you can even use speech marks because if you outputting some dialogue and you wanted to say something like this he said and then you added your own quote in there if you want to put something in quotes then you can't because the speech mark dictates that this is the end of the string literal that's why it's gotting it off like this and then now it's not recognizing that something is just wrote here and what it's actually doing is you've got two strings specified one that says he said space and one that's just empty and then you just have this something that's just in the middle of course we actually want to insert the speech marks within another pair of speech marks this is where the backslash comes in so you can insert a backslash before here and this is now acceptable and the same thing with the normal backslash because the backslash character is also going to be the Escape character then you need a double backslash so then that equals to a single backslash when you print it out let's Show an example so we have C colon SL slash which will return us back a single slash but visually right now it's a double slash but when it gets processed or outputed to the screen you'll see that it's a single slash so this common example is when you're constructing a path together and you want to use backs slashes to denote the different directories so let's output this to the screen and see what happens and as you can see we have a single backslash because of the Escape character we don't see both of them and if we print the Spree out to the screen just to show you that as well then we can see that there's only the speech marks around the something and we don't have the backslash you can tell when an escape character is being used because it goes a slight hint of yellow instead of the normal color for a string so now that we've worked out that this is how this works let's see a way that we can undo this to make it easier for us so you've used the dollar sign for string interpolation and you've used the plus just to concatenate two variables together and just as a quick example it looked something like this your name is and then the name variable and using the plus you would say your name is followed by a space and the quotation marks and do plus name that's fine and now we have another one so similar to how we placed a dollar sign before the speech marks we have a Verbatim identifier and what this means because it says verbatim it just means whatever you see is whatever happens so let's try and Define this path a slightly different way but still containing the exact same information that you see when you print out to the screen so let's have a look we can reassign the path value and just before the speech marks we can put it at symbol and this at symbol means it will actually negate all of the Escape characters it will process a single backslash as a single backslash let's take this line of code and place inside here now what you see is that tint of yellow is no longer there so if we print this past to the screen let's see what happens we actually get the double backslash because it's ignoring all the Escape characters which means if we take them all out this actually looks exactly how we want and you don't have to worry about the Escape characters there you go these two are identical even though one is being displayed using Escape characters and ones using the verbatim identifier please note that if you're going to use the back slash n for example and I'll just demonstrate at the end of this new line test and if we run that code again you'll see that it's printed the path on one line the back sln has made it go on to the next line and now it's printing new line test on a dedicated line that's fine the problem is if you use a back sln or a back SLT or any of these Escape characters during the at symbol then it's going to process it as literal characters which means you can't mix a back n with an at symbol AS this is just taking the text verbatim so if we try to run the code now you'll see the back sln will actually appear in the code if you wanted to do this then maybe you could remove the back slash n and add a plus at the end and then make another string that just has a back sln and then this string will not be processed as a Verbatim string because we don't have the at symbol right before it so then we can have the exact same thing here just to show you this so now these two are identical again just as shown here and as shown here the difference being that we can't specify a back sln in the same string we actually have to concatenate them together because of the verbatim identifier so let's have a look at speech marks so if we have a string name and we can make this equal to hello and then someone and we said before that we have to use the backslash so we can activate the Escape characters and that will work and if we just print that to the screen to make sure then we get hello someone in the speech marks if we add the verbatim identify at the start then we see we've got an error it's trying to process it differently this is a little Quirk with the verbatim identifier if you want to insert a speech marks you actually want a double speech mark on either side the double speech marks will get processed as a single speech mark because it's within a speech mark the verbatim identifier needs to know that you're specifying a speech mark and this acts as a same reason why you have a backslash here it's slightly quirky doing it this way but it still works as per you expect and when you're specifying something like name and we can say hello someone so let's print name to the screen and make sure it works in this case we don't actually need to specify any sort of Escape character because the quotation mark is a separate character to the speech mark and it doesn't interrupt anything by placing a quotation mark inside the string just represents that as its own character let's run that and make sure it works there you go so just as a quick recap Escape characters are very essential because we can use things like back SLT to give us a tab character in our console output this can be very helpful cuz you can almost mimic the use of columns inside our console output you'll notice that back sln is used quite a lot in the console output so you can separate lines without having to use multiple console right lines if you have a single backslash you can't have it on its own if the string is not a Verbatim string you have to pair it with another character otherwise you will get a syntax error if you want to use the verbatim string then you can put an at symbol before the string definition and then it will ignore all of the Escape characters for example using back sln within these speech marks will mean that the back SL n will literally be printed to the screen and you won't get the new line functionality that back sln provides when you want to print speech marks of the screen using the verbatim identifier you have to use a double speech marks in order for it to show up and as you can see it slightly goes yellow and that's the similar notation as using Escape character when you don't have an verbatim string if you're using other characters that are similar to a speech mark like a quotation mark because this doesn't interrupt the syntax of the language then this is fine because a character can just be inside a string and to the compiler this is just a character even though they are very similar the quotation mark doesn't affect the speech mark the most common approach for outputting values to the console is by having this format you type something in as a static string and then you add a variable to it but when you're doing long sentences this format can get messy quite quickly so this will just output both of these on separate lines the name followed by the name variable and the age followed by the age variable I just have a console right line to split up these two sections just so you can see it visually in the console so if we run this code you can see that both the outputs are exactly the same and the reason why is we can use this back sln what this back sln is doing is inserting a new line character just where my cursor is here which is forcing The Edge to jump onto the next line the reason why this is a slightly different shade to the age text is because it's an Escape character back sln means new line we'll explain this in a further video in this section so don't worry about that just know that it means that it produces a new line so as you can see since we're adding the name followed by the name and then the age followed by the ede then it's getting a bit long and a little bit tedious it's not too bad in this case because we're not really printing out a sentence we're just going straight to another line but let's see what this is going to look like if we start dealing with multiple pits of data your name is followed by the name and then we can add a comma and your age is and then add the age and as you can see while we're structuring a sentence then it gets a little bit long we have to remember to put in the spaces otherwise our code is going to look funky when we print out to the screen and the reason for that is there's no spaces between the name and the age variables so let's put them back in and make sure the output looks all right now that the output looks like this let's explore composite formatting and what this means is we can get rid of all of these plus symbols and replace it with curly braces so let's actually output this string again but just output it completely static your name is abber and your age is 23 and now if we've run this you'll see that both outputs are identical this is because I know the values for the string variables up here and I can input it straight into here so now that we know what our sentence is going to be we don't need to add any pluses what we do need to do is remove our variables so in the case of this sentence our name variable is here and our age variable is here so we can replace this with this curly brace notation we can have curly BRAC and then we want to start this value at zero throughout the string you want to have these values starting from zero and going up incrementally from left to right so our next variable would be our 23 and we can store it like this now that it's got your name zero and your age one let's see what happens when you output it then we just get this and this is very confusing that's because we're not done yet so now that we've got our string typed in we can actually place a comma in here and now it lets us put any object in and any object could be a string an in a double or any data type so we want to insert the values inside here going from left to right so our name is first and then we do a comma and we type in Age and what this now says is the name will get replaced by the curly brace zero and the age will get replaced by the curly brace one so now if we run the code let's see what happens and now you'll see that the output is exactly the same and now look at the difference between these two lines you'll see that these multiple amount of pluses are not confusing and let's say you forget this one then you're going to get a syntax error and it's a bit frustrating to keep on typing when you're trying to join things together now we can clearly see that this flaw is like a sentence and this space here looks very unnatural but this space here looks like it's part of the sentence which makes our code a bit more complete and the same goes if you want to print something like this and let's convert this one so if we copy this line down into here and we just remove the spaces then it can look something like this name followed by the name we don't actually need this space here because we're going to be going into a brake line we can replace our name with curly braces zero and our age with curly braces one and then straight after we can type name and age and if we output this we'll see it's exactly the same there we go so just a quick recap print ing strings and any other variables to the screen has been normally achieved by doing a string followed by a plus and then adding another variable to it adding more than one can be a little bit complicated and hard to track of all the spaces that you're going to put in and you might accidentally miss one of them like this one here or this one here are very crucial to the output if you miss this one then it's going to say is followed by the name all together with no space we then introduce composite format in which lets us use this notation of curly brace Z and curly brace one to give us the ability to store some variables outside of the string and then insert them in dynamically we took both of these examples and made them down here using composite forming so let's explore a new method of concatenation that makes this look a lot better the reason why this is an issue is you have spaces in here and sometimes you might forget these spaces and it could mess up your program this string here looks very unnatural because you're forcing the space but when you run it you'll see that it is actually what you expect the spaces are complete and it makes perfect sense but when you're writing it it kind of looks a little bit stupid because you're forcing the space and then adding a plus and then the name and then another plus and then another static string and this just get a little bit long to type it's fine when you have a smaller sentence like this but when the program starts to grow it could be a little bit problematic and you'll have a lot of syntax errors when you forget to type in all the pluses locally this can be fixed let's duplicate this line down and let's see what we can do so we have this thing called string interpolation and it uses a dollar sign as a reference we can place the dollar sign before the quotation marks and then what you can do is you can actually keep this as one big sentence so let's remove all of the values and have it like this so now of course this actually doesn't print our variables because we've just replaced it with text so if we just run this then it's completely messed up because now we're not using our variables and this can be easily fixed because we've used our dollar sign now we can actually wrap our variables in this curly brace and now you can see it's went white if I double click on it you can see that it's referencing the variable wrapping the variables in the curly brace means that they can actually be processed variables even though they are still within the speech marks please do not remove the dollar sign because now this will be interpreted as string text as you can see here putting a dollar sign at the start will make into string interpolation and then we get the ability to have our brackets this can make string concatenation very easy to do because you don't have to worry about all the pluses and adding them together and don't have to worry about the spaces as well this looks more like a natural sentence and what you can do for practice is you can actually just type out the sentence your name is AB your age is 23 and then from there you can actually just break down the variables and know that you'll need one here so you can replace that with name and then you'll know you'll need one here so you can replace that one with age and then you can place the dollar sign right at the end and then there you go you have your solution this method means that it's a lot cleaner to read easier to maintain and make changes in the future and that's the whole point of programming if your code base is very difficult to go around and understand what's going on and potentially make changes in the future then you've already made a bad step and you don't want to get into these nasty habits it's fine if you're just going to have something like this where it's not really complicated at all a string plus another string that's quite simple and that's fine you don't have to go the extra effort to put in the dollar sign and wrap it around in the curly braces even though I personally still would because in my personal opinion this looks a lot better than having it like that you can see that it's a lot neater it takes up less code and you can see visually that you're using a specific variable and you don't have to worry too much about the spaces because this looks like a real sentence explore another method of string concatenation which is the idea of taking strings or objects and add them together to form a sentence of sorts we can say your name is followed by a space and then add the name followed by a space add your ages and then add the actual age variable and we can also write the exact same line using string interpolation or composite formatting just like this and like this we can specify the dollar symbol and put our variable in the bracket which is shown here and here and for the composite formatting we can take the content where our variable would go and replace it with incremental numbers 0 and one wrapped around in a curly brace and then specify in the correct order zero takes a value of name and one one takes a value of age if we run this code you'll see that the outputs are identical so let's explore this other method we have a string test for example and then inside the string Library we have this function called concat and it can taking any amount of parameters that we want to give it so we could say your name is space and the quotation marks and then we can add a comma and then we can say we want to add the name and then another comma and we want to add and your ages and the speech marks add a comma add the age variable and that's it and we could just use CW tab tab and type in test and let's run it and see what happens and now as you can see we get the exact same output and because this just returns us back with a string we can also just take this entire line and paste it straight into the console right line you don't necessarily have to store it but you can if you want to and there you go all methods produce the same output another way you can use this concap function is by giving it an array we haven't covered arrays so far so I'm just going to show you this for demonstration purposes don't worry about understanding it so just a quick explanation arrays are just ways of storing multiple of the same data type so if we have these three names inside our names we can actually use the console to print them all out so we can say string. concat and then we can concut the names together which will just add all of these three together now the problem is when you've run it you'll see this stuck together so what you could do is just add a space between them and as you can see this is getting a little bit tedious now there's other methods that we can use to concat some arrays together and I'll show you that in the next section but for now don't worry about it this is concentrating on the string concat function and we'll just demonstrate that again so if we run the line of code we can see that they're all the same so now that you have four different methods of printing out exactly the same information you might be asking yourself what's the best method I personally prefer to use the string interpolation because with this one you can easily miss the spaces and you could produce a bad output and it might be stuck together it's fine when you can see the lines right in front of you and you can easily identify the spaces but when you're adding about 10 variables together then it could be a problem the reason why I like string interpolation using the dollar signs and the variables in the curly braces is that you don't have to rely on missing out spaces because it actually forms a sentence and you just replace the use with your variable composite formatting which is this one is very efficient and very nice to look at because it allows you to specify the sentence and then plug in the variables after the only problem with this is if you were to change this value in the future or to change a sentence you have to make sure that the numbers add up just like in the first example if you only have a short sentence then this isn't really an issue since you can see it all visually and you also got to realize that these need to be in the right order because if you put Age first then it's going to put age in this one and name in the second one and that's going to be problematic cuz it now mess up the sentence using string interpolation you don't actually have to worry about anything because if you wanted to change this to say your age is then you simply just do this and that's very easy to do because in this case you'd say your age is and then you'd have to change a string and then now that this is zero we need to change this from being age and this one to be name whereas in the first example you could just easily change the value in the curly braces instead of changing this reference and the end reference cona is not widely used just because you have all of these methods available where you can easily add stuff together but there could be user cases later on down the line where users just so it's a bit more obvious and it helps the readability of your code and maintain within a big project or just on your personal projects when you're looking back at your previous code when you create and initialize a string variable you might want to give it the value of an empty quotes and this will just default the value to essentially nothing you're giving it a value but at the same time the value doesn't actually contain any sort of characters if we print this out to the screen then you won't really see anything this video is going to focus on string.empty and string.empty will actually just represent these quotation marks string. empty will represent these speech marks so what we can do is we can type in string using a DOT and then we can type in empty just like that we've initialized our string name to a value of empty now this isn't necessarily used when you're declaring and initializing it because this is almost identical to just defining a string on its own main reason why this is used let's say we actually ask the user to input their name so we can say a console. write enter your name and then we can take this string variable move it down use an alt and then arrow keys and remove this and let's initialize it to a console.readline to read in the value from the console and now what we can do is using our is string interpolation method that we just learned we can print to the user your name is and then the name in The Curly braces now let's just see what happens so let's actually type our name in Abba and it says your name is ABBA but what if the user just types in nothing and just presses enter Then it still says your name is blank now let's see what we can do here we don't necessarily want to say your name is blank we want to check what this value is so we can say if the name is not equal to empty quotation marks then we can output your name is and then then else we can say name is empty and then if we run it now and press enter it says name is empty so we can use string. empty instead of these quotation marks this looks a lot better when you're trying to compare it AB your name is Aba and then when we press enter it says name is empty this just helps to keep your code a lot tidier just so you don't have to write the two quotes if you accidentally put a space in there now your if statement is incorrect if you always use string. empty then it just helps you to make sure that your code is going to be maintainable and readable in the future reading string.empty gives you a better representation of what's going on instead of two open quotes if there is a situation where you want to check if one string equals another string then you can do the following if message equals equals compare then we can print out same and then else we can print out different and as we can see here they both have a capital H and they both say hello so they should be identical let's run the code and find out so they say same which is exactly what we'd expect so we have another method of being able to do this so even though we can apply equals equals to two strings it's normally better practice to use do equals and then place the other string inside the brackets so you're saying if message equals compare now if you run the code you'll see that it's the same output in certain circumstances where you want to ask what the user has entered enter your name and then we can use a string name equals console. readline we can say if the name does not equal to empty strings then from there what we can do is type in your name is plus name and then we get some output your name is abber but since we're checking if it's not equal to that that means they've entered something in let's see if there's another way that we can actually write this so if we just duplicate it and comment it out so we got it for reference so what we want to do is we're checking if name is not equal to empty quotes so we can say name do equals empty quotes but what this is telling us if the name equals empty quotes then we should do this so then what we can do when we learn about the if statements is we can use the not operator and we can say if the name not equals to empty quotes then we proceed with this line L we can just say invalid name input let's run that and see what happens to type in AB then it passes fine and if we type in nothing then we get an invalid name input the reason why equals equals and the do equals function are different is because lower level using equals equals will actually compare the reference in the memory and the reference in the memory is what's used up when you actually create these variables so what this is doing is it's comparing the value that's actually stored in memory to the other one that's stored in memory now the problem is when it comes to something like arrays where you actually have the same value but they're slightly different let me demonstrate so I'm just going to use this code because we haven't covered arrays yet so I'm just showing you an example if we have a chart array that literally says hello and then we can use this line of code to join them together but this is actually an object instead of a string but if you see what we can do in the if statement we can say save the message which is equal to hello we can use message. equals and we got the new compare and this is actually an object so now we're comparing a string with an object and generically speaking an object can hold any sort of value because all of these variables that are strings ins double Etc they're all derived from something called an object which is just a very generic way of storing information so since these two data types are little bit different they still evaluate to the same thing what the equals function is doing is actually checking the literal values of the variables instead of checking the values that are held inside the memory address location and the difference here is even though we have a character array that is giving us the values hello and our string is also given us the value of hello if we run this line of core that uses do equals then you'll actually see that the second same actually represents the bottom if statement so what that's doing is it's actually giving us back the comparison saying that it's true and it is indeed true because hello is literally equal to hello but if you were to use the double equals then what you'll realize when you run the code is now it will say it's different because what it's doing now is it's taking a string object and comparing it to an object and they are not different because of their memory and that's what the equals equals is comparing it's not only comparing the value it's comparing the memory address location and that's going to going be vastly confusing because you don't want to hit these situations so it's always best to use the equals function because the equals function is concerned about the values rather than where they are in your memory I hope that made sense and it wasn't just confusing but basically when you use equals equals it checks the values that are actually wrot in your computer's memory instead of the value itself it will do both it will check the memory and check the value whereas when you use do equals it is only concerned about about the values and that's all that matters when we're doing an if statement like this we're checking if they're both the same so it shouldn't really matter how and where they are stored the only thing that matters is the values contained within the variable we're only caring about the values and not where they're stored so when we have a string variable defined in C we have it like this and when we print it out to the console we get the entire string being displayed but what if you want to return the first element back not the rest then what are your options so in the later video in the course we covered the substring function and technically you could go from the first character till the second character and you will just get C back so that's index zero till index one and you'll get the C back now the problem with that is that's an extra function call or something that should be quite simple and it is a message is a string and strings tend to be an array of characters which is similar to this we haven't learned about arrays so far and we'll cover that in the next section but what an array essentially is is it lets you store multiple of that data type so we could have a chart array that holds exactly the same value and each position will hold each one of these characters and the reason why I'm mentioning this is because with strings you can use the square bracket notation so if you add some square brackets at the end it says here it returns back a Char and it takes in an index gets the CH object at the specified position in the current string object so if we use message zero you can see that returns back with a ch ch right here gets the CH object so we can call this on a string and it can return us back with a character because like I said with the array of characters that's essentially what a string is each one of these is just its own independent character and a string lets you pair them all together so if we print this out then we should get C because it's zero based so if we copy this down and use one 2 and three then what should we get we get C then we get actually nothing technically because it's a space character and then the third character which is the fourth in the list because it's zerob based is going to be our I so let's just print this out to the screen and see what happens there we go so even though we don't see it visually there's actually a space character right there and that's the third character in The List which is right here so of course we don't tend to know how long the string is unless we can see it visually and if you were to reference one of these values and the string is not actually that long then you have a problem let's demonstrate if we have the string just called C and let's comment out the rest then that's only two characters so only zero and one will be applicable these two will return back something let's have a look and see what happens so the first character and the second character will run fine and let's put a console read line in there just to break it up so the other code doesn't run yet if we run the code we get our C and that's the max length of our string so so far it's zero and one now if we press enter let's see what happens we get an index out of range exception index was outside the bounds of the array and the reason for that is we only have two characters inside our message and we're trying to display the third and the fourth this is problematic because we literally don't have any of them characters to display so what we can do instead is actually write ourselves a little Loop to go through the entire string and return us back all of these character positions instead of us just get ing how long the string is so if we return this string back to normal and then just after this little section we can write a for Loop in I equals 0 and I is less than message and then we have access to dot length this gets the number of characters in the current string so we don't have to worry about the maximum length in the square brackets we can always rely on do length because we don't have to keep track of it and the language can know that for us and give us the value in this case we're going from zero to whatever the length is these characters are and then in here we can actually just console right line and we can do the same notation we did here we're say we want to print the message but not only the message we want to print the index and the index is going to be I in this case because we start at zero since it's zero based and then we're going to the last character so let's print this and see what happens so now we get C Is Awesome from here down to the bottom c is awesome print on every single line and that's a little bit annoying to read so what we could do is just change this to a console right and maybe we can just comment this section out just so we can see this properly there we go so we get c is awesome and because it's a console right it's right in them all next to each other and they're being printed out one by one let's add a cool little effect that can demonstrate you for now so inside the system. threading Library we have this sleep function so what we can do is we can add another using command system do threading we already have threading do tasks in there but the function that we need is inside the threading Library so there's two ways we can write this we can actually write everything by hand like this do sleep or you could just remove the system do threading because we've added it at the Top If you don't want to add it at the top that's not really a problem you can just include it straight into here adding it at the top will include it within the entire project but if you're only going to use it once or twice then sometimes it's better to just include it straight into here because it'll make your overall program size a lot smaller so let's just keep it in so we can make our code a bit more readable so we have thread. sleep and what this will do is it will suspend the current thread for a specified number of milliseconds there's a th000 milliseconds in 1 second so what we can do in here and we're trying to mimic a typewriter effect so we can say something like 200 which will be roughly a quarter of a second so if we've run the code now let's see what happens so we get this cool effect where after it prints out each of the characters characters it will print out the next character only after it's been asleep for a quarter of a second and that looks kind of cool if you wanted to speed it up you could just decrease this number there you go of course if you make it too low then it might be too fast for you to actually acknowledge what's happening and if you also make it too slow then it's just going to take too long to turn off and at that point you can use control+ C on your keyboard or use the stop button at the top to terminate the program okay so let's have a look at another thing that we can do with this so maybe we can make this 100 for now in the previous videos we've used a function called contains and let's say we're just checking if it Con turns C and we know it does because we can see it visually let's run the code and we see we have true being printed and the reason why true is actually on the same line as c is awesome is because we're using console. right here so it's actually not made a new line character just after the E so when it's printing true it prints it straight after that so what we can do do to fix that is just place a new line character in here using console. readline and we can just drop this a little bit lower to 50 there we go so we have true and what we can do with this is we can actually make our own little version of the contains function let's demonstrate so if we make this exact for loop again in I equals z i is less than the message. length and i++ so first let's kind of understand what's going on with this function returns a value indicating whether a specified substring occurs with in this string and what that means is it will return a Boolean for us if C is inside our message then this will return back true and we know this is true because we just outputed to the screen and we can see this visually so what we need to do is we need to Loop through our message and try and figure out if we can find C inside our message and then we can give back a value of true so maybe we can do a bu contains equal false and the reason why we initial it to false and the reason why we initialize it to false is because we want to set it up telling that we haven't found it and then inside the for Loop if we find it then we can set it to True let's have a look so after the for Loop we can print contains of the screen and then inside the for Loop what we can do as we've seen here it returns back every single character so you'll get back C sharp then the space then I then s and so on and so forth and what we want to do is we want to go through each of the characters and then just ask if the variable is equal to C if C is equal to C then we can assign this to true and then go through if hashtag is equal to C if space is equal to C and so on and so forth so we can write a if statement here that says message square bracket I is equal to equal to apostrophe C and the reason why it's an apostrophe is because this is a character and this also returns us back with a character so we need to compare them both like that if we use a string in here then it might complain that we're trying to convert between a chart and a string and it won't let let you do the equals equals operator between two different variables maybe what we can do instead is to follow the approach that we used before and use the equals function and place our C inside here so if the character that we're currently up to inside the for Loop is equal to our C which is what we want to search for then we can set our contains variable equal to true we don't need to write an lse statement in here to set our contains to false because we've already gave it a value at the start if we didn't have this value then it'll be beneficial to do this but since we have it then we can remove this other path and we don't exactly need it so let's have a look and see if this works perfect it says true maybe we can change this character to something like air make sure this works which it does as well so perfect so now we've made our own mini little contains function inside here and we can also use the C library one but the purpose of this exercise was just to show you how we can iterate through a string variable and and then decide what each of the characters can be equal to and then we can decide if they're equal to another one and then let the user know that we found a match for their search term so far in the course we've covered the equals function and the contains function when you're searching through strings or trying to find values let's have a look at a method that makes sure a string is valid before we can process information on it so in this quick example we have a name output we're reading the value into a string name and then we simp complet output it to the screen if we run the code and just press enter then it says your name is blank and we don't really want that because we want to check if your name is equal to something before we continue so let's look at some methods so we have if the name is not equal to nothing and then let's just print zero to the screen and that's one of the methods and we can say if name is not equals two quotation marks then let's print out number one so what what this is doing is checking if the name is not equal to empty quotes and then this is doing exactly the same thing except we're using the equals method and let's just run the code and press enter and you can see the zero or the one doesn't appear because it's detecting that it contains nothing so if we type in a real value we can see Zero and one coming up so these are both valid ways of checking if the string is not empty so let's look at a third one and this one is actually very important for reasons I'll explain in a second so inside our string Library we have is null or empty so we place our name inside here and let's see what this says now indicates whether the specified string is null or it's an empty string so this can be very effective so what this reads now is if the string is null or empty then we print a value but we want it to be not null or empty because it wants to have some contents so if we type a value in again you'll see now we get all three numbers and what them three numbers mean is that it's past all of these checks and each of these checks just ensures that the value has got something inside and that's fine but it can be slightly problematic for this reason using this method and this method are fine in some cases except as it says here it checks if the string is null and null means it doesn't have a value but it just has nothing instead of something let me demonstrate if we assign the value of empty quotation marks this actually has a value but the contents is empty but it's still a string as it comes up in here if we assign this the value of null then it's just a keyw that we can use to denote that this literally has no contents it's not that it has an empty string CU an empty string is still actually a string whereas a null it just means the variable is blank now this is where the issue arises if we try and call a method on something that's null Watch What Happens we actually get an exception and our program just crashes you can't run any code on something if that variable is actually defined as null it doesn't mind if you check the value of it but if you try and run a function then you've got a problem so if we comment this line out this ensures everything it ensures it's null or it's empty and this is the belt and braces option because if it's null we don't actually get an exception when we try and run this code as follows we get the zero showing up because our variable has something that's not speech marks and it's actually null so we want to avoid this option as well and also avoid this option in case our string is actually genuinely null using is null or empty we'll check both for the value of null which it is right now and if it's got empty quotes EG the value is empty so if we just run this again and have these two paths commented out we can see that two is not appearing if we change this back to our console readline and we try and do it then we get our number two because it's validated that this string variable is got something inside it and the variable is not actually no this is a very good way of being able to make sure that your program doesn't get exceptions as with calling these equals if you want to call equals then call it inside here you can check if that variable equals something by simply placing that if statement in inside here after you validated if the name variable actually has some contents if it's null or it's empty running equals on it will just break the code further and you don't need to check if it's equal to Something in here maybe you were checking if the value is equal to abber or something along them lines and now if we run it again we actually get the output correct it's best to Nest them like this because if you run this function on something that's null it's actually really safe but as you saw previously if you run a function on something that's null then you're going to get a null reference exception and your program will close down and break you want to avoid exceptions at all cost so nesting it inside it is null Remy check will be perfect for your code it improves the stab ability of your program to ensure that exceptions don't happen so in this exercise I want you to ask the user to input any message and then I want you to print the message in Order character by character and then also print it in reverse character by character let's get started so we could just have a console right line but let's change it to a right and just say enter your message callon and then speech marks and then just have a string message equals console. readline perfect so in order to be able to Loop through the string message we need to have a for Loop if you remember from our previous videos we can have this string variable followed by a square bracket and then and then we can have an index inside and that will print us back any sort of index based on that position so if we just have this is a test then it's prob print as the T because that's the first index and so on and so forth so what we can do with this information is take what we can do with the string index and then also use the property which is length and then use these two values to be able to process this is a test so we have the first character square bracket 0 and the last character is at length 14 so our message variable now contains 14 characters obviously When I close the program then that value is lost and I have to re-enter it but because of that exact reason we would always use do length because we never know how long the user's input is going to be so we can have a for Loop so we can say 4 into I equal 0 I is less than and we can use the message. length here and then we can say I ++ so you want to start at zero because our first index position is inde Z and we want to go from the index zero all the way to the length now in that example I just printed out 14 for the length but you got to realize is there might be 14 positions but there's only 13 indexes so it's not actually 13 index it's just up to 13 when you start at zero going from 0 to 13 gives you 14 positions so when we're saying 0 is less than the message length then that will actually take us from 0 to 13 instead of 0 to 14 if we made this greater than or equal to and change this to a one for example then that's going to go from 1 to 14 and first we're going to miss out the first character and we're actually going to go one over the message length so you always want to start from zero if we're going through the entire string so this will go from 0 to 13 and then here we can just have a console right line and just print message square bracket I and then just for the time being we can comment out these lines just so it doesn't saturate the output so let's run this Cod code and see what happens this is a test and then we get them all on separate lines maybe we can just use a console. right instead so we get each character on the same line instead of a new line character being outputed at the end of each of the lines so we can say this is a test again and there we go we get this as a test outputed as well so now that we've printed that in order let's see how we can print it in reverse so just a quick little tip throughout this C I've been quite hard on you I've made you WR the for Loop out exactly the way it should be but all done manually this is so you can get used to the syntax and after a while once you understand exactly what to do then what you can do is when you type in the four you can see that it says there's a for snippet tab twice to insert the for snippet and we can do that now and it actually gives you a little bit of an output you can see these sections that have been highlighted the reason they're highlighted is once you're done with one section you can actually press Tab and it'll jump to the next one so now my cursor is jumped on the length and we can type in message. length if I press tab again then it'll just keep cycling through them until we're done and we can press Escape upon pressing escape then it gets out of the little message and there we go we've now just defined a really quick for Loop please only use this once you're comfortable writing for loops and don't use them immediately because you might get stuck on what to do and how to do it so it's best to always write the for Loop syntax out from scratch so you can get used to the three different sections so this is actually a for Loop that goes forwards it's going from 0 to 13 but what we actually want to do now is go from 13 to 0er so let's actually change this for Loop completely and we can do our little shortcut again so if we do four and then we don't actually want to start on the value is zero we want to start on message. length and then you want to minus one and just as we said here we never actually want to get to the length because we want to go from 0 to 13 so if we want to go backwards we want to go from 13 to zero and the only way that we can get this 13 is by getting the 14 value which is message. length and simply minusing one so now that we've got our first variable which is in I equal message length minus one which will give us the 13 we want to go from I and instead of less than it's going to be greater than or equal to and then we actually want to change it to a zero because we actually want to stop at zero in this case and then we don't want to use I ++ because if we start at 13 we want to go down in one instead of up in one then we can simply just do minus minus we can take this exact line and print it out to the screen and if we just print something small in between like a hyphen just to separate the two outputs and let's see what happens test there we go so we have test and then t s e and t is now in Reverse but now you might be wondering if we had a shortcut for the four what what's this for with an additional R Cordes n it for a reverse for Loop so if you tap tab twice you can see that we have exactly the same format in I equals something minus one which we have right here and then we have I is greater than or equal to zero as is we have here and then we have IUS minus just like here so we can literally just change this into message do length and then these two now are exactly the same so just copying this down we'll get us exactly what we need but obviously we just wrote this I just wanted to show you the shortcut so let's try it with a longer string this is a test there you go and if you wanted to you could just print these on separate lines so you can just change this into a right line for example and have it like that it doesn't really matter the rest is up to you but the task is just so you can print it one way and then print it the other way I realized that what you can also do is just simply print a console right line and have message in there and just get rid of this completely and the output will still look exactly the same there you go and the reason why I told you to write the for Loop is not because it'll be easier if you do this it's more for your Educational Learning purposes having more practice to how to iterate a string variable is very helpful for the future and you can understand it fully if you just print out to the screen then you're not learning anything extra you're just applying what you already know so let's just have a quick recap we ask the user to enter the message we STW it into a string variable and then Iden demonstrated that you could use the square brackets to Output the first index then you can output the length of the entire variable using a follow you can go from zero to message length which will give us from indexes zero up until 13 in this case and then we can go through i++ incremen in one and then we can have a console right which will just print out message index I for the index that we're currently up to and then we break it off with a console right line just in the middle because these are printing on the same line so we need to insert a new line character at the end after we've done that what we can do now is print it in reverse and now we can do exactly the same thing except from 0 to 13 we go from 13 to zero so we start at the message length minus one because the length was 14 and now we minus one to get to 13 and we're going from I is greater than or equal to zero because that's the value that we want to stop at and then we can do I minus minus if we were to take out this equals operator let's see what happens test and now we're actually missing the last character because what we've done is we've actually went from 13 to 1 instead of 13 to 0o so let's put that back in and make sure it works and then we have t set for test and then we're outputting the exact same thing in both for Loops because we're simply just printing the character that we're currently up to and because this for Loop starts at zero and this for Loop starts at the length minus one then they outputting the same values or what it appears to be the same values it's just starting at different indexes in this exercise we're going to be building some sort of a password validator this can be present in something like a register form where you ask the user to enter their password and then enter it again to make sure that they've entered it correctly so you want to ask user to enter their password in twice and store them both check if they both contain something if they do we can print out password match if they don't passwords do not match and if they both contain nothing then you want to Output please enter a password so let's get started first we can have have a console console right we can have enter password string password equals console. readline and then we can just copy these two lines down using contrl D and then we can have a password C for password confirmation and we can say enter password again and let's just print these out to the screen just to make sure we know what's going on just like so so we can have abber and then abber again so now we have both AB stored and that's fine so let's see what we can do now we need to check if they both contain something so what are the different ways that we can do this so we can have if password do equals and then we can make it equals to string. empty and because we want to check if it's not empty then we can simply place the not operator right at the start and then we can join them with another one not password. equals and then exactly the same thing string. empty but in this case we don't want to use password we want to use password C there we go so if we've came into here then that means they must have entered something so let's just quickly do our exit path which is if they're empty please enter a password so we can say else and we don't need a condition here because if this were to fail then it has to mean that their passwords empty so we can have a console. right line and we can just do please enter a password and let's just test if this path works first and we just press enter twice and we get please enter a password and maybe if we typee something in for both and then we get nothing because it's actually came to here now perfect so if we come through and we can say password equals equals password C or we could use the equals function and we can say password. equals and then password C and if they both equal to each other then we can print out passwords match there we go and if that were to fail then we can print out passwords do not match here we go let's run that let's find out ABA and ABA and we get passwords match and if we try ABA and ab two is and then we get passwords do not match so what are some other ways that we can do this you can structure this completely differently right now we're doing both checks in one single if statement and we can actually split this up into two and then provide a different error message so right now this ISS please enter a password you might have entered the second one but not have entered the first one or vice versa but it doesn't matter because you have to enter both of them in order to pass this validation check so what you could do instead is actually put another if statement inside and paste this one inside here and then just keep these as two separate if statements and then you can actually provide different error messages so let's Nest this in one deeper so we can say if the password is not equal to empty and if this returns back true then this variable has something inside it and then once we go inside these curly braces we get another check and if the password C is not equal to nothing then that means if we've came in here then we pass both of these validation checks and both of them contain something and then we can proceed to check the variables so what you can do in the first L statement is you can say please enter a password but on the second one so just after this curly brace we can have another L statement or we can say please enter a password confirmation so I know that was a bit quick so let's just have a quick recap so we can have one if statement that processes the first password that you type in and if this is empty then it says please enter a password and if it's not empty then it'll go inside this curly brace hit the first line and check if the password confirmation is not empty if it is empty then it'll say please enter a password confirmation if both of these return back true then it will go inside the success path in which it will actually check if password is equal to the password confirmation and we can say the passwords match or if they don't equal to each other we can say the passwords do not match let's run that and see what we get so if we type something in for the second one but not the first one so for the first one we just press enter and then let's type something in for the second one and it says please enter a password and then if we run that and do the complete opposite type in p and then press enter for the second one then it says please enter a password confirmation so you can see immediately what we can do is provide a different error message for different situations if you include these both in one line then you can only give out more of a generic error message this is similar for when you go to login and when you get your password or email wrong it doesn't say which one you've got wrong it just says them generically which one you've got wrong it says invalid credentials or invalid username or email it will say them generically like invalid username or password but it won't tell you which one it is because hackers can exploit this and you don't want to be doing this but in the case of a password confirmation and this is just for a register form then it's not exactly the worst thing to do this because sometimes what you'll see is the text boxes might go red to indicate that they're both not equal to each other and this is fine on registration but it's not fine on the login what we can also do in here once we've checked if they're both not equal to something we can actually just validate how long the string needs to be we can have if password. length and let's say you had a restriction and it can only be over six characters and we can say six and password c.length is greater than or equal to 6 and once it passes all three of these checks then we can check if they're equal to each other if they got something inside and if they've got something inside and if they've got both the length is greater than or equal to six then we can check it so we can have something like password and then password and then this returns back with password matched if we have something like abber then it's actually returns back nothing because we don't have an else for this specific bracket so we can say else conso right line please enter six or more characters so if we type in Alit twice then you can see we get this message now please enter six some more characters so right now we have a validation for the first password and the second password and for the length and if all these checks go by then you can process the actual passwords that they they've entered and check if they're equal to each other you can technically do all of these checks in one line it'll just be a pretty long line but what that means is you can't have three separate error messages like this if you have it processed in one line the only error message that you can give is very generic there's no one generic message that can fit for password empty and the confirmation password empty and for the length so maybe what you could do is chain the both of them to be check if they're not empty so then you can process a message with something like please enter a password and then you can have another check for the password length just to let them know that they need to enter six or more characters but in these off into two separate checks is going to be very helpful because it'll let the user know something a bit better than a generic error message so in the previous examples throughout the course we've actually talked about using the two lower function and I said in majority of cases where you want actually compare two different things you want to actually use the two lower function or the two upper function and you can achieve this by having two lower just here and then also two lower just here now the problem with comparing if they're both equal to each other but checking the lowercase values is this is indeed a password if you're checking if the user has inputed any capitals lower case symbols Etc then there's no point in applying a too low function because that will just ruin their actual password and reduce the security so in certain cases you don't always want to use two lower and two upper for comparison you want to just check the value straight up and the same thing is when you're doing a login you don't want to be checking their values lowercase because that's their login these are some of the specific situations where you don't want to be using the tow function if the data that you're processing is pretty sensitive and will be messed up if you use the toow function that you should always avoid it passwords fit this perfectly and usernames as well if someone's added some capitals inside the username then you don't want to ruin that by doing lower case or upper case if you're your username is spelled like this and you try and log on like this then they are not equal to each other because this will probably be two different accounts you can have an account with a capital B and have account with a lowercase b so you don't be lower casing the input and then doing a comparison because what you might actually retrieve is a different account than you're looking for so now that we talked about stuff theoretically let's see how we can do things practically so as you heard in the last video arrays are a way that we can store multiple variables of the same data type in one little group so if we had something like Nome 1 = 5 in n 2 = 10 in N 3 = 15 and we had a similar case in one of the exercises like this where we had to work out if a triangle was actually a triangle so we asked user to input three different angles and then we stalled them all and then we added them up after and it looked something like this in total equals num 1 plus num 2 and then finally plus num 3 and then we had some sort of if statement after to check if the total was equal to 180 and then we did something in the curly braces just output that it's valid and then else output it's invalid you can see how this gets a little tedious we have to create a new variable every single time we want some more data to be stored and in this case we just simply want another number that we can store but we have to just keep a pending one to it in that case we could have angle one angle two and angle three but how about if you have something that just called angles for now let's just talk about how arrays work and how we can use them and then after I've went through this example about arrays and taught you what to do with it then I will go get the code from the exercise from the triangle video and actually transform it into using an array so you can see what the difference is and how the new code will look like so let's get rid of this little section so now that we've got three integer variables let's see how we can do this another way so the Syntax for arrays you first type in the data type that you want just like before and then you add on a square bracket and a closed square bracket there's nothing that needs to be inside as of right now then you press space and type in the variable name as per always and then we can make that equal to new in 3 so what this side of the equal sign means is we want a new instance of an integer array and we want to have three positions since we have three variables here that we want to store we need to have three positions to stall them so this line in total says that we want to integer array we want to call it numbers and we want to instantiate our new integer array with three positions instantiate is just the term that we use when you turn something into a new class at this point if we don't use new then we're going to get compiler error because it's unsure what this is trying to tell you it's trying to St an integer inside integer array and that makes no sense so it won't recognize the square brackets in this case because it has no idea what it's trying to do and this syntax is completely incorrect so the compiler doesn't know what error message to give you so we can have a new int and what we can do now is by using the square bracket reference we can actually specify these three variables inside our numbers array so now we have access to numbers 0 = 5 and then if we use controll D to copy this down twice we change this to one and two and then print 10 here and 15 here so now this is exactly the same as this we have three integer variables defined separately as 5 10 15 and now that we've created an array of numbers we can specify all three of these values inside our numbers array so instead of having three individual variables now we just have one that holds everything like a group and just to show you how this works if we have a console right line we can say n one space num two space num three and if we use control D to duplicate that down then what we can have instead of these num ones is simply just place these values inside changes to one and changes to two and what you should notice is these two lines are going to print the exact same values there we go so in this example we've took our sloppy code that will roll us around appending one to this number creating a new array and then printing it out so let's say we want to actually use these to read in values from the console what can we do and you'd use these exactly the same as how you use variables up here this is just an integer variable at a specific position held inside a group so we could simply have a console right line delete the right and just say enter a number and then instead of starting five we can say convert to in32 and then we can have a console. readline and that will read in from the console convert it to an integer 32 and then store it into the first position of our numbers array now if we just copy this down twice and we can get rid of these two lines cuz this is just staring it statically and add one and two to here so now what we're saying is enter a number St into 0o 1 and two and let's see what happens now so now we get asked the numbers 10 20 and 30 and you can see that they've been stored here of course these haven't changed because this is still referencing our static variables up here so what you can see in this example is now that we've made an array we can specify each of the values very easily inside here and if so we wanted to have a number four instead of to duplicate it and rename it and change the value for example we can just simply turn this into four duplicate this little section and then just change it to a three one thing to note in C and many other languages almost every single index will start at zero in the last section we covered the string functions and they also started at zero when you're dealing with strings and their positions when you have a for Loop of the string then you always want to use index zero as the first position the same is true here we have four positions which means it goes from zero all the way till three it never goes from 1 to 4 or from 0 to 4 these are bad values it always goes from 0 to 3 you might be thinking this looks really good but when we go to print it we're going to have to copy and paste this little section add another one and rename this to three this gets a little bit tedious if we just trying to print them all to the screen so let's see how we can fix that we can use a four Loop for this so we can have four in I equals z i is less than and then we can have numbers do length and if you notice from iterating through a string variable the syntax is exactly the same we have a do length property on the arrays as well as we do with a string variable so in order to print out this line what we can do is print one of them every time we go around the for Loop instead of using a console right line we can just use a console right so we can have console. right and then what we can simply do in here is we can say numbers square bracket I and then we can have a space right after it just to M make what happens here we have the number printed out and then a space after it number printed out a space after it and so on and so forth so let's see what happens now if we run the code 10 20 30 40 there you go so you can see that these two lines are exactly same and now what happens is let's just comment these two lines out and if we were to change this to five and we can duplicate the section changes to a four and then now we have five variables started and we don't need to touch this for Loop because the numbers do length will get updated anyway so we can have 1 2 3 4 five and you can see all five variables have been printed automatically what also is quite tedious here is we're having to add another one to this just so we can ask the user how many times that they want to enter a number again this is quite tedious but we also have a fix for that because we know how many times we want to ask the user to enter a number then we can use a for Loop to iterate through and ask the user as you can see every single line here is exactly the same except for the index position that we're dealing with and the same is true for this for Loop this line will always be the same as we're printing out here and the only thing that changes between this section and this section is the fact that this says one and this says zero so we can translate this into a for Loop to make it Dynamic and we can do exactly the same thing above here so let's actually copy and paste this for Loop because we want to do exactly the same approach we want to go through all the positions inside our numbers array and then we can actually ask the user to enter a number in so let's block comment out this massive section and then we can take one of them and place it inside the follow Loop so now we're asking the user enter a number and then we're storing inside index zero and of course if we keep using index zero then it's just going to override the first one and we're not going to store any data so we can change that to an i let's see what happens when we run it now 1 2 3 4 5 and then we get the five numbers being printed this is awesome because what we've got now is five output commands coming straight to the console just from a for Loop the for Loop is responsible for printing them all out to the screen reading in the value convert it to an integer and then store it inside our array and then we have a separate for Loop to print it out to the screen what's really really powerful about these two for Loops that we've built is if we want to have 10 numbers now we simply just change this to 10 and then just rerun the code as you can see we now have 10 numbers there you go so what we've just done if we move this code down a lot now just so we can have it close by we've made our entire program that was actually pretty lengthy in into just a couple of lines and two for Loops one for Loop is responsible for looping x amount of times x depends on whatever that number is and then we go through and ask the user to enter a number read in from the console convert it to an integer 32 and start within the array after this for Loop has finished running then we have all the numbers stored inside our array and then we can go through and print them all out to the console another way we can print this out to the screen is by actually using a for each so we can say int num and then we want to be a number inside our numbers so for each of the integers inside the number we want to create a new local variable called num and then we can use it in here and if we take this line and copy it down everything's exactly the same except we don't need to specify the main array numbers now and we don't need to specify the square brackets we can just change this completely and replace it with n and if we just make this number smaller so we don't have to Output a lot of values 1 two and three and you can see that they're exactly the same there's no line between them because I don't have a console right line so let's quickly add that in and there we go 1 2 3 and you can see they're outputting the exact same values the reason why I needed a console right line is because these four Loops are using console. right the problem with console. right is even after finishing writing all of the lines it doesn't continue to the next line it stays there so if I don't break up the two outputs with the console right line then all six outputs from the console right and the other console right will all go on one line this is just for demonstration purpose anyway either one of these Solutions are fine more people tend to use this one the problem with these two options is you can't always use them interchangeably this one will always go through every single position it will always go from zero and it will always go to the length the problem with this for Loop is you can't choose how many times you want to iterate through before you stop there might be a very specific case where you have a big array of data but you only want to select the specific range if an example where you had a th000 array positions so from 0 to 999 and let's say you wanted to request and run a for loop from 500 to 600 so you would literally type in 500 in here and then 600 inside here and this would be fine as long as your array has that many positions but with the four each Loop Loop if you run for each loop on a thousand length array then it's going to go through every single position in some cases you might not want that and you only want to go through specific cases so if you know you're going to go through every single case then you can use the for each but if you know you're going to go through a certain amount of cases then it's always best to use the fall Loop okay so we covered quite a lot in this video so let's just have a recap so initially we started off saying we have our num one num two and num three then we had our static variables St inside there and then we created our integer array which is now down here and just to make it a little bit easier to store multiple variables because if you wanted five variables you'd now have to duplicate that and change that to number five and this will get very tedious if we had something like 10 like before this is very long and you don't need be specifying number 10 in your code because this also hurts the readability of it using arrays can solve this problem quite a lot you can easily specify array using this notation int square brackets followed by the name and you make that equal to a new int three the three can be any number that you want as long as it's a whole number cuz this tells us how many positions that we've got we then outputed lots of values to the console and read them into our Ray but we had the same problem as we did above where we just had to keep duplicating the sections so what we did to prevent that is by writing a little for Loop that went through every single position in numbers array I puted something to the screen readed in the value converted it and stored it into the array and then after all that was done we can use a for Loop or a for each Loop and print that back to the screen now that we finished the base cont of this video and because I said at the start that I was going to take the triangle exercise and convert that into an array so let's do that now so now I've copy and paste a solution from the triangle exercise straight into this project I've just block commented everything above just so it doesn't interfere with our code so let's just run this code to familiarize us with what's going on so if we enter 60 60 and 60 then it says valid and if You' run it again and enter something else that doesn't equal to 180 then we get invalid so let's see how we can make this code a lot better by the use of arrays so as we said before we don't want to be using this angle one angle two and angle three let's make a int square bracket angles equal new int and then in this case we have three angles and what you could do as well is you could say con int angle count equals 3 and then you can simply use that inside here so later on in the code if we wanted to specify this to a different value we can just change that later on so now that we've got the three angles we can get rid of these three lines and write ourselves a little for Loop so I goes from zero all the way to angles. length and then every single time we go around in the for Loop we want to say console right enter angle one and then we can say angles square bracket and not zero in this case cuz we don't to be specifying index as it will go from 0o to 1 to two we want to be using I I because we're inside a for Loop that's already going through all the indexes forers and make that equal to convert to in32 and then a console. readline now we've got all the values stored inside here let's do deal with this problem so if we just comment out the total for the time being let's run the code oh we have one more error down here sorry let's run the code again and we can say enter angle one and we can type the values in but as you can see we've got angle one for each of the times what we can do in here is use our I index to print out the value so we can turn this into interpolation and then wrap the one inside curly braces and we can simply change this one to an i and let's see what happens now so we have enter angle zero and then one and then two and this is fine but humans don't like reading zero they like reading 1 two and three so what we can simply do is say I + one and because we're using I and then adding one to it it's not going to affect the variable inside the for Loop so there's no problems by doing this this is simply just for the output purposes so now we can have 1 2 and three just show up like that perfect so what we can do now that we have all the angles stored now we need to replace this line by writing a for Loop that can add up all the values for us so we can have for each in angle inside our angles and we can just say int angle sum plus equals angle the problem with this is we can't specify a new variable inside here and then use it outside an if statement so what do we do in this case you want to take angle sum and initialize it outside the for Loop and then give it a value of zero and then inside the follow we can remove the int and we can say angle sum plus equals the whatever angle that we're currently up to so if we had three values that's going to say 0 + 60 and then take that value and add another 60 and then take that value and add another 60 so it'll keep a running total for us and if we just print out angle Su to the screen let's see see what happens 10 20 30 and now we have 60 and that's the correct calculation if you add them three together so now that we have a running total for angle sum then we're pretty much done if we get rid of this line of code which is our previous total and we actually bring back our if statement there you go there's no error now and all this is doing is checking if the angle sum is equal to 180 and then print valid and invalid so we can have 60 60 60 and it prints out valid and let's just comment out our output and then we can have 60 60 59 and then it prints out inv volid which is exact same behavior that we saw at the start so let's remove the extra code in here and keep it like this there you go so now we've got our solution just like this and it's a lot better because if triangles were to transform in the future and we wanted more than three sides then we can easily update this value because now that we're using arrays or we're using a for Loop to enter out the values what we can do we don't actually need to store it what I mean by that is we can actually just get rid of this array completely let me demonstrate we can take this angle sum and place it underneath here we can keep the count so we can use that in the for Loop so we going from 0 to three because that's our angle count and then we can get rid of all this and let's see what we can do now so we have an angle count equals 3 so we go from 0 to three which will'll just do as we said before from 0 to two because it's less than the angle count and let's just print this to the screen see what happens so the output still exactly the same but what's happening is these values are not being stored they're just being shown to the screen and then not done anything there is no equal sign here to assign it into anything so what we can do is we can say angle sum plus equals the value straight away and now if we try it 60 60 60 then we get valid the main differences between the these two situations is in the first one we used an array to store all the different values and then we added the total but if we're not going to use these values after then what's the point in storing them we can just use a for Loop to ask the user how many times they want to input the values and then just add them every single time that they add the calculation in and at the end we could just simply use a conditional operator to be able to print at the screen whether it's valid or not but let me just undo that solution so I can show you the array solution and we can have a quick recap that was just an extra little tip just in case you wanted to know what different ways you could use to make this work there we go so let's just have a quick recap here so we have a Conant which all we'll do is let us specify three inside here and then we can use it here this isn't entirely necessary but it does clean up your code a little bit because it gives this number three a bit of a meaning it says the amount of angles is our angle count having a three left over like this is what we call a magic number they're quite bad because it hurts the readability of your code people want to know what the three actually means so if you bring in an angle count then you can actually read we want a set of angles and this is the amount that we need and that's denoted by angle count it adds text to a variable it gives you a way of making sure that the text equivalent of a variable is present so someone can just read it after we've created our integer we can actually make a for Loop that goes from zero to the length and then we ask the US it to enter the angle and in the previous example we had enter angle one 2 and three so now we can mimic that by using I but because I starts at zero we want to use plus one every time we loop around the for Loop we ask the user to enter the number read it in through console read line convert using convert 2 and 32 and then store into the array after this for Loop is finished we have all three values stored in the angles array and then we have an In Sum to count up all the values that we need and and then we use the fall Loop to go through every single integer value inside and make a running total and store it inside angle sum once angle sum has the total count then what we can do is use console right line along with the conditional operator to print whether it's valid or invalid to the screen in this video we're going to look at how we can use the built-in array functions to be able to sort an array so if you have an INT array called numbers and then using the previous notation that we looked at we can actually specify any numbers that we want using a common delimited list so if we just have nine numbers inside here then we've actually defined an integer array and then the compiler can count the amount of items that are inside here and give it the length but we don't have to worry about that ourselves so if we use a for each and we can just print Inn inside numbers we can do a console right line on the new local variable called num if print it out we can see all of the values and maybe we can actually just use a console right followed by a space just to give them all on the same line there we go so as you saw before if you had a string called test and we wanted to do something to it for example if you wanted to use the replace function if you want to remove all spaces with an empty string then if we check the replace tool tip we can see that it returns a new string most of the string functions will return you back the new string after doing something with it but in this case if we type type in Array followed by do sort and we can place our array straight in the bracket what you'll realize is if you hover over sort it will sort the elements in the entire array but it will indeed return back a void and void just means it returns back nothing so in this case what it's doing is you're actually affecting the numbers array straight away and you don't have to do numbers equals array. sort numbers for example if we were doing the test replace we would have to do this otherwise this would just be returning back a string but we wouldn't be using it the same is not true for the arrays when you run the array functions they tend to return back void and you don't have to do anything other than give it the array that you wanted to sort so now if you run this code you should just see the same output since they already sorted anywhere so let's change some of these numbers up and just see what happens now there we go 0255 6 7 899 and that's it sorted just like that there isn't a whole lot to this sorting function but what you should note is you can use this new array syntax to Define how many items that you want in there instead of having to change the amount of positions that you have using the square brackets you can just denote any number of items that you want inside the compiler will count them for you and press the length straight into the brackets for you so you don't have to worry about it using the array. sort function all you have to do is give it the parameter of the array that you want to sort and it will affect the array straight away and you don't have to restore it and then we're just using a simple for each Loop to print them out to the screen in this video I want to discuss the array reverse function so if you hide an INT numbers equal new int and if you just had lots of numbers in here defined just up to five then we can add a semicolon and again using this array function we can see array. reverse and pass our array inside and then we can just use a for H our item inside our numbers and simply just print them out using a console. write and we can use string interpolation I just put a space at the end there we go and if you run the code then you can see our numbers have just been reversed there isn't a lot to this video I just wanted to show you about the different functions that you have available for arrays these can come in handy when you have something like a list return from a database for example and it's ordered in a certain way let's say you're returning back a list of lots of people who ordered back alphabetically and it's going from a to zed and let's say you have some sort of user interface that allows you to flip the order instead of having to request the database to get the data back in the opposite order you can use this array function to just reverse the list the same thing goes if you're trying to order by lowest price or highest price you can use this to show the different values in different orders that's where this array function comes in handy when you have different situations like the names or the price by ascending or descending where you can just flip the data and instead of having to request it back from the database again flipping it locally is a lot easier than going back to the database as that uses more data and more computational power on the back end and then return it to the front end it's always best to be able to use these functions instead of having to use external things to be able to return back the same data using it locally like this will give us a performance Advantage because it's done directly on the data instead of having to request everything again if you wanted to do this manually let's have a look and see what your options are you can have your integer array just defined like this with a dynamic list and then we can have a sorted array using the same length as the current array what you can do instead of using reverse we can actually just comment these lines out you can bring back a normal for Loop but if we use two RS it gives us a reverse Vol so the length is going to be our numbers do length and the rest of the paramet is exactly the same we want to go from the last minus one all the way till zero and we want to decrement in one and we can say our sorted number I is equal to numbers I but all this will do right now is just give us back the same value stored so what we need to do in a case like this is make another variable something like X and we can store that into zero and what we can say is X is assigned the value of whatever this numbers is because this is going backwards but we want this one to go forwards CU we want it to be reversed and we can say x++ and see what happens when we run it now so so nothing's going to come up because we don't have any output so let's use a for each we can have V number inside our sorted numbers and we can just take this and place it in here and just print out the item and we can use num and there you go it's been flipped the exact same value is just the other way so this is obviously a little bit more complicated because you have to use an additional variable use a backwards for Loop and then incom your own separate variable and as well as completely make a whole new array of course you should only do this if you need it as two separate arrays if not you can always just affect the one that you're up to right now because I said before that arrays are actually static data and they're going to be fixed size then there's no way to remove or add an item but you can clear what you have already so let's have a look array do clear set a range of elements in an array to the default value of each element type so the first parameter takes our array so let's use numbers and we want to start off at the index that we want to clear from and let's just say zero and because we want to clear the entire array let's go all the way to numbers. length and now let's just produce a for each of our item inside numbers and then just have a console right string interpolation which just prints out the item followed by space and now let's run the code and see what happens so we have lots of zeros in the console and this is to be expected because as we've talked about before for the default value for an integer is indeed zero so all this is doing when it says it's clearing it's just actually assigning all of the positions the value of zero and we can mimic this quite easily through a for Loop so if we comment this out and write ourselves a for Loop in I equals z and we want to go to numbers. length and then simply inside we just want to say numbers square braet I equals to Z what you can also write is the word default this will pick up the default value for the data type that you specified you can type in zero or you can type in default it's up to you but I think in this case if you're trying to reset it back to default then you don't have to worry about remembering it or any typos you can just use the keyword default so if we run this code now let's see what happens so effectively we've mimicked what this function is doing but let's have a look and see what other parameters we have access to so if we comment this out and drop the value then you can still see we only have one Constructor normally you'd see the open down arrows on the left hand side to say one of two in this case we only have access to one Constructor it will only give us a range of elements we want to remove but really we just want to clear it does say here in the tool tip the array whose elements need to be cleared and because it is a clear and not a remove you got to remember when using this function it doesn't actually remove any of the positions it just resets the values inside the array so what we can do in this case is we can say numbers comma 5 comma 5 and what that will do is the first parameter is where you want to start so if you want to start at the fifth position and then we want to count five forward and because we have 10 numbers then this should return back okay let's comment out this for Loops it doesn't take an effect and let's run the code and see what happens now so now we took the position five which is actually the sixth number because it's zero base and said we want to remove five forward so itself and then P more forward and there we go we have five numbers being removed so instead of removing all of the different values we can actually clear a certain amount that we want and to mimic this in a for Loop we can do the following we can start it at five and we want to go to 10 and let's run the code and you can see the output is exactly the same when doing in a for Loop you need to actually calculate what this is going to be so we need to take both the numbers the fifth index and the five length which is 5 + 5 and then we get 10 and we don't make this less than or equal to 10 because we have 10 numbers so actually want to go from position five to position 9 which will equate to less than 10 we actually want to go from position five all the way to position 9 which actually covers five numbers 5 6 7 8 9 even though it feels like the difference between the two numbers is only four because 9 - 5 is four but we actually have five numbers between that 1 2 3 4 5 there we go so when we print the values from 5 to less than 10 we're going from 5 to 9 which is exactly what this is doing this is the index that you start at and this is how many numbers you want to count forward so let's just have a quick recap of this function we defined our numbers array using array. clear it doesn't actually clear the values it just gives us access to removing them back to their default values it doesn't actually clear the array it just resets the the values back to their default type we can have numbers parameter which will equal to our array and we want to say we want to go from index0 all the way to numbers. length which will be every single value inside the array and all that will do is go through the array and set them all to their default value which is similar to what this for Loop is doing and before we had inti equals z and I is less than numbers. length and that will go through every single position you can technically use zero instead of default but that would mean you have to remember the default value of every single data type it's easier to just write the default keyword and it doesn't promote any typos using the default keyword is by far the easiest and the most safest option if you're going to have this situation so making every numbers index equal to default in this case because we're using integers it's going to assign the value of zero and then after this voles run with I is zero and I is less than numbers. length it's going to make all of these positions equal to zero which is in essence what this function is here for because arrays can't be added or change in terms of the values that they have after they've been created you can only really modify what's already there or you can reset them all back to zero using this notation from zero to numbers length you can get rid of all the values and make them all zero using five to five means it'll start index 5 which is the sixth position and then go five numbers forward so it will delete these and reset them back to zero you can mimic is and a follow Loop just like this start in I at five and then go to less than 10 and the reason why it's less than 10 is 5 + 5 gives you the 10th index but because it's I is less than 10 you actually want to go to the ninth index because from 5 to 9 that's actually covering five different numbers and then we can go through and assign the default value and then when we print it out you'll see that all of these numbers have turned into zeros just like so searching through arrays are very helpful when you try to find some data inside your array and you want to return back the position to maybe do something else with it so let's have a look at this example so we have a numbers array and let's say we want to search number 199 and find the index of it so first let's ask the user what the number they want to search enter number to search then we can have in search is equal to convert to in32 and we're converting the console. readline and then let's have a look at the function so inside the array Library we have an index of searches for the specified object and Returns the index of the first occurrence in a one-dimensional array this is very important as it says the first occurrence which means if there was another 199 at the end it's only going to return you back this one and then stop immediately and not give you the value of this one so let's have a look in the parameters and see what it takes it takes our array and then a value so our array is called numbers and the value you want to search by is our variable called search if you hover over the index function again it says that it returns back an integer zerob based index of the first occurrence of the value in the entire Ray if it was found otherwise the value is going to be minus one so we can say in position is equal to this and because it says if it's going to be found then it's going to have the value of a zero index and if it's not going to be found it's going to have the value of minus1 so we can say if the position is greater than minus1 because if it's greater than minus1 that means the value is zero onwards we can also write this by saying if the position is greater than or equal to zero it's just up to you they both mean the same thing and then we can say in here number search has been found at position position there we go so let's run the code and let's do a perfect situation so we can can say 50 and you can see it says number 50 has been found at position three and that's the fourth index since it's zero based and what you could do if you wanted to is actually add one to this just so it looks like a bit more of a readable number because four is going to be the fourth number 1 2 3 4 and let's try find a number that hasn't came up like 60 it's going to return us back with nothing this is really bad because it looks like the search has failed which it has but you need to Output message to let the user know so have conso right line and say number search has not been found let's type that again 60 number 60 has not been found so let's see what we can do to be able to write this function ourselves if we just block comment this for the time being we can actually use in position equals to minus1 and the reason why I make it equal to minus1 because when we read the tool tipe of this index function it said if it's not not going to be found it's set to minus1 so why don't we set it to minus1 first and then we can try and find it so in I equals 0 and we want to go to numbers. length and inside here we want to scan each of the positions so we can say numbers square braet I and if that is equal to our search then we can set the position equal to I if the number we're up to is equal to what the user has typed in then we want to set our position to the index we're currently up to and we don't need to have an else because we've already set it to minus one and after the for Loop we can actually take this if statement and put it back down here because the code's going to be the same if the position is greater than minus one which in this case is our default value so in essence if this value has changed then this should always pass EG we've found the number so let's run the code and let's type a number in 30 now it's found at position five now if we try 60 again number 60 has is not being found there we go so this function is exactly doing something similar to this it's going through every single position finding the variable and if they match assigning the index and then after just returning back to position back to the console so let's comment our example and let's see what other variants of the function we can use and let's comment back the first one so using this line we can duplicate it and just comment it so we have some other parameters inside here if we add a comma we can actually give it a start Index this is the starting index of the search and let's say you only want to search from the second number onwards then you can just type in the number two so now if you've run the code and type in 90 it's going to say 90 is not found cuz 90 is the first one and let's try a value like 50 now it says the number 50 is being found at position four because now it's included in the range from two onwards because this is two onwards it'll be position two until the the end of the array if you wanted a very specific range then you can actually give it another value so we can say we want to go from zero and then we only want to go to forward so if you run that now and type in 22 it says it's not being found cuz we' started here and we said 1 2 so now it's only searching between 90 and 199 and if you wanted to include the middle ones you could say you want to start a position one and go to forward so now you get these two numbers and so on and so forth so now if we try number 90 you'll see it's not being found because 90 is not one of these two the reason why you'd use different ones like this if I revert back the first one this will go from two till the end this will go specific range and this will go through everything the reason why these exist is if you have a very very big array let's say it's a th000 indexes then you don't want to search everything unless you really need to let's say for example you had a names array and it was sorted off alphabetically and the person's name that you wanted to search began with an a there is no point in running the search all the way from a to zed if you know it begins with a and let's say for example you found the first index of the user that has a name B so you have now the indexes from the start of the array up until the last array position that has the value of someone's name beginning with a so now you have the two indexes of every single a name inside this array if this was a this was B and this was C and this was D and you had these two positions then you should only be searching all of the a names instead of searching the entire array and the reason for that is you'll be searching lots more data for no apparent reason and it's going to take an extra long time for searching something that you're never going to find if you're searching for a name that begins with a there is no point in searching for anything a BCD and so on and so forth that's where you'd use the very specific range you can say you want to go from zero all the way up to the first B name so then you're only searching the a names this is just one example and there is a lot more every situation is very unique so use the parameters that you want and always use the ones that can get you the best performance the least amount of things that you can search is the best way forward if you don't know what you're going to be searching then you should always use the top one which will just search everything if you know where the value is going to be or roughly going to be the then you can use this one or this one to give you a better range and it's a bit more focused instead of searching for everything so a quick recap of this index function what it will do is it will return you back to position if it's found it the position will be zero based just as arrays are if it hasn't found the position then it's going to return this variable with minus one so therefore after you've run the code you can check if the value is greater than minus one which will be from zero onwards if the value position is z onwards then you know that that number has been found and you can use the position variable to Output that to the screen if the value position is minus one it means the array index function has returned back negative and the value position is now minus one so you can output to the user that it has not been found just in my little explanation down below you can see that we can mimic this function by setting the value of position to minus one using a for Loop that goes from zero to numbers length and if you wanted to as well you could use these inside here if you wanted to mimic this this goes from two till the end so you can say I equal 2 and you still want to go to the length this one goes from one and then to ahead so you can actually put I equal 1 and then because it's two ahead from one instead of numbers. length it will just be I is less than three because 1 + 2 gives you the three so in order to do this manually you can Lube through the elements that you want check if the number you're up to to based off the index position of I is equal to the search variable that the user typed in up here and if you find a match then you can assign the position to the value of I after the for Loop is run you can check the same if statement as we discussed above these are copy and past it down below just to give you an example in this little section all these arrays have static data which means that when you initialize them with a certain length you can't increase that length or decrease the length you can only modify the data inside it and you can't delete any rows if you create an array of size five and you only store three people in then now you have two positions that are being unused and that's unnecessary amount of data stored in your memory if you're not going to be using it up in certain situations like when you're making a game for example Tic Tac Toe then you know you're always going to need a 3X3 grid so a 2d array will be perfect in this situation cuz you know the exact width and height height of your array so you can do this perfectly whereas lists are quite Dynamic if you don't know how many people are going to be within a system for example if you're signing up some sort of register for a class or for a school or something of the sort and you don't know how many people are going to be in that class then you can use something called a list a list a dynamic cuz what you do when you initialize it you just say that you simply want a list and you can add items and you can remove items and you can also modify them if you wanted to expand the size of an array it's slightly complicated but it's not impossible so if you had int numbers equals new int and let's make that length four and let's say we had a numbers array that we wanted to increase to length five we could have new numbers change that position five and then what we're going to have to do is from position zero all the way to three which is our fourth length from the numbers array we're going to have to copy that into 0 to 3 of the new numbers array so now they have the extra data plus the last one which will give us our four so that'll be five length 0 to three gives us our four numbers and then we have one empty one so we've just made a new array and then copied all the data from numbers into new numbers now of course this is not really practical that if you want to reduce the size or increase the size you're going to have to do this each time of course you don't want to do this you just want to use something called a list so let's stick with an example and see what we can do so you make this and three and let's just put three numbers inside here if you remember from the array video we can also declare it like this we can say number 0 equal 1 and then one and then two and change these values these two are doing exactly the same thing I'm initializing it with 1 2 and 3 and also just saying that all the positions in here are equal to 1 2 and 3 so we don't need this twice but I was just showing you as a quick recap so we're declaring array we're calling it numbers and we're giving it a length of three and initializing it to 1 2 and 3 now let's see the syntax to define a list you start off with the word list and then you have a left and a right arrow which makes a little section inside the section you actually want to State the data type that you want so if we're copying the numbers array we can have an INT inside here and that's it for the Declaration of the data type and then we can say new numbers or List numbers equals to new and then there you go it gets Auto filled for you but let's just type it in we have list open the arrow in in the middle and then close it so now it's the same on both sides but because this is a new we need to add a Constructor so we can open the curly braces and the first Constructor says initialize a new instance of the list class that is empty and has the default initial capacity press the down arrow we can give it a capacity of the number of elements that the new list can initially store so we can start it off with five length or three length or whatever it doesn't actually matter it just means that we actually have three positions available immediately if we place three in the brackets and the last one we can actually give it entire collection so let's say if we loaded a list of numbers from a database or a list of something from database and we can actually insert it straight into this list by putting a list inside these brackets of course right now we don't have a list that we're going to assign it with so let's just leave this empty and close the brackets and add a semicolon so we could say list numbers do add and then we can add one and then duplicate this down and add two and add three so now these two have exactly the same contents instead of doing this you can have the same notation like this so you can have the codyy braces in here and we can put in one 2 and three now that's doing exactly the same thing and you see I can just keep adding more numbers in here and the list simply doesn't care but as soon as I add one more into here then I'm going to get a syntax error because it complains that the length is not equal to to the numbers that we have because the list are really Dynamic it doesn't matter how many you put in here because it can just go on forever of course until you run out of memory so let's have a little working example just to see how this works so we can have a for Loop and we can go from 0 to 10 or maybe 0 to 3 just so we don't have to enter as many values we can have a console right that kind of just says enter a number and then let's read that in and we can say in n equals convert to in 32 and we can place a console. readline inside here and then after we've got the console read line we've got an inome that's being converted from the console input inside our integer num and from there we can take our list numbers do add and we can add the num inside there or if you want to reduce a variable you can just take this line and place it straight into here now if you get rid of that when this fall Loop runs will have three iterations let's run the code and find out 1 2 3 so now we've ented three numbers and now they've been stored in the list so let's create a follow loop after and we can go from zero all the way to list numbers do length but of course when we're using list we don't have a length anymore when we're using arrays we have length because arrays have a fixed length whereas lists have a count of the items inside it so instead of length we simply use count and then inside here we could just do what we normally do and say list number numbers square braet I and let's run that and we should see the numbers printed back out in the exact same order 1 2 and 3 and the same principle goes if you use a for each Loop we can say V item inside list numbers and that's all you need to do and you can just print item to the screen now we should see the same output twice let's have a look at other values that we have inside here so we type in list numbers Dot and let's have a look at the functions inside so we can add which you just used above we can convert it to an array we can remove a specific position and we can clear it completely they have other ones in here like binary searches we can check if it contains a certain element this is going to be very handy when we do our remove we can convert them all to a different type we have a copy to we check if a value exists inside we have a find finding all of them the difference between these two is the find will return back the first one whereas find all will retrieve all the elements that match it finding the index of a specific match finding the last index iterating through them all you can insert a specific position whereas the ad will just insert at the end of the list adds an object to the end of the list inserts an element to the list at a specified index and then you have remove which gives you the first occurrence so you can type the number straight into there so you can ask the user what number do you want to delete and if they type zero it will delete the first zero in the list and you can can remove all so if you want to remove every single zero inside the list you can do that as well or you can remove a specific position this is the most used function because what you can do and what you can do is use the find index search for an element that matches a condition and then returns zerob based index the first occurrence so if you want to delete the number zero from the list you could use find index and that returns you back with an INT and then you can use the remove at and then pass that index straight into there you can also sort it so it goes up in number order we did this with the array. sort function as well and if you wanted to you can also reverse the entire list this can be very helpful as we did with the array functions if you just wanted to reverse them all in case someone had something like a filter when you're doing from Price high to low and low to high the difference between them two lists is simply the list flipped so let's run a remove just inside here and let's see what happens so we can say remove that and let's say position zero so we type in 1 2 and three you'll see that 1 2 3 gets printed out and then I'll hit this remove at and it will delete the first index and in this case the first index is going to be our number one so now this has became our first index and this is our second index and it's got rid of the number one so let's move on to a different data structure called dictionaries dictionaries are generic collections that store key value pairs in no particular order they take in a t key key and a t value and these just mean the key and the value can be any data type that you want dictionaries come under the system. collections. generic namespace and if you don't include this line at the top then you'll have to type in system. collections. generic space dictionary every single time you want a specify dictionary putting the name space at the top will include it within the project and you can use dictionaries freely so one thing to know is the keys must be unique and they cannot either be null values can be null or duplicate cuz they're the value values depending on the key as long as the keys aren't the same then the values can be similar so let's have a look and see what we can do we can type in dictionary and you can see it has the arrows either side and you can see here it says T key and T value and what T key and T value is is it gives us the flexibility to add any data types that we want we can add in two strings in here for example or we can do anything that we please so in this example I just want to start a list of names and I want to give them a unique identifier and this unique identifier will just give them a number that their profile is up against it's the same way whenever you make an account with any sort of website when your data gets stored in the database you have a unique ID for your account and this is the same thing that I'm trying to replicate here we have a unique ID and with that unique ID comes a name so we can say equals new dictionary just like we do with the list we can end the brackets and end the semicolon there and now we've created our dictionary and the exact same principle we can use with the list we can simply type in the name of the variable of the dictionary and type in add and then we have access to int key and string value and this parameter is going to change if this now becomes a string as I'll show you now and if we reopen the bracket you'll see this has turned into a string key so that will change depending on the data types that you specified so let's say we want to add one and we want to add ourselves then we can dup at this down and add in two and three and we can say test and test and now if you run the code you'll see that we have no errors and nothing's going to show up I'm just demonstrate that it compiles okay and the same thing with the list we can also simplifies the initialization process and it looks something like this so because this is a key value pair we can no longer just type it in one line they need to be in a little block so when we wrap these around the curly brace we can have the key on the left left and the value on the right and one of these is called a key value pair key value pair and we will use these in the for each Loop in a second when we print out all the values to the console so let me just demonstrate something about what I said at the start I said that all keys must be unique and there's a reason why I said that if we duplicate the first entry therefore giving us the same key as one and we try run it and let's see what happens we get something called a runtime error this runtime error happens when we run the program and it's got nothing to do with compile time or our logic an item with the same key has already been added so we need to watch out if we do this because our program is going to compile but it's not going to work at runtime and let me demonstrate another fact if we make this number four and our values are exactly the same once we run this it will still work fine values can be the same but the keys cannot be the same the keys have to be unique so just like with our lists and our arrays we can use a for each or for Loop to access this directly so we can say 4 in I equal 0 and we want to go names. count and the same reason it to do count for a dictionary as it is for a list but it's not for an array dictionaries don't have fixed length and neither do lists they are very Dynamic and basically are a list list can only store one different data type whereas dictionaries give you a key and a value so as we said above we have a key value pair so let's try and print this and see what happens have a console right line we can say names square bracket I and that will give us back the position the issue with this is it will just give us back the string and let's just see what happens if we print this then we get an exception because no key was given and the problem with this situation is we can't use this like a list Geto sets the value associated with a specified key what this means is when we give our square bracket I inside here this is actually not talking about the index this is actually trying to do a search on these keys so if you actually change this to one then we should get ABA return back this is not actually doing an index Lo up it's doing a key lookup and the reason for that is what we're going to have to do instead is say names do element at and then what we can do inside there is place our index so this element art will return us back with the key value pair as I said above here so how this variable works is we can do key value pair and then we need to specify this variable the same way we've got it up here so we have an INT inside a string and then we can say a pair and make that equal to the function called element at as that returns us back with a key value pair in string and of course if you wanted to make this a lot smaller you could just simply use VAR but let's keep it as key value pair just so you can understand what's going on and the reason why we need to get the key value pair is if we want to retrieve the integer and we want to retrieve the string and now we can use pair. key and pair. value and because these are both integer and this one is a string it matches our pair exactly so we can take these values and go to our console right line and we can say something like this use string nipulation and say pair. key and then maybe add a hyphen and then say pair do value and then just remove these two lines and let's try and run it now there we go so we get all the values and it doesn't matter what this key is it can be something random it doesn't really make a difference like I said this doesn't have to be in a specific order so let's keep it as 1 2 3 there we go so you can see using a for each Loop to print this is a little bit more complicated let's have a look and see what it takes when you use a for each Loop for each VAR item inside our names and as you can see here our item is automatically a key value pair of int and string and again what you can do is type this straight into here just so you can get used to the notation and there you go it's still a key value pair and then now what we can do is we can take this exact line and paste into here and instead of pair we have item and this should return us back the exact same values and if we just separate with a console right line there we go okay so now that we've understood this let's take a look at an example let's comment this out and let's create another dictionary so we can say dictionary and then we can have a string of string and we can call this teachers equals new dictionary string of string again and we can add our curly brace just so we can add our Valu straight to here so as you said before we need to open curly brace and close curly brace and then we can say the math teacher is called abber and then we can add another one and we say the science teacher is called test there we go so we've initialized our teachers and we said that the value that we want to give it is a unique identifier which is going to be our string assigned to the subject and this is going to be the teacher that is assigned to this subject so what we can do inside here is we can have a console right line and we can do something like this so remember when I was saying in the for Loop we can't actually use the square bracket notation like this because this is inferring to a key rather than a position so we had to use element at just to find out the key value pair and then to print out to the console so because the square brackets is an actual sech let's try and make use of that now so we know that there's a math class available so we can type math in here and what does should return us back is abber there we go so what that's doing is it's searching through our dictionary find ing this element inside here and then return us back with the value for that key get all sets the value associated with the specified key the problem with using this approach is it says here if the specified key is not found a operation throws a key not found exception let's just say for instance I mistyped the math and now we're just going to get a runtime error and it's going to be a horrible exception and our code is obviously going to break this is similar to what we do when we have int. trass we don't just trass it immediately and convert it it without actually checking if it's a valid value so instead of doing this line what we can do is we can check if that key exists first before we then use it so we can say if teachers do try and get the value which is a similar to what we have with trass and then the first parameter is the key that we want which is going to be our math and then out here is going to be the variable that we want to Output out so we can say out teacher and then open the curly braces and then inside here we can print out the teacher so we try to get the value for Math and if we found that key inside these then we return back the value inside our teacher the same way works for our tripassure if it successfully passed it and if it hasn't we can say cons output math teacher not found so let's try and run that now you see we get return back abber and if if you actually drop the lower case then it says the math teacher is not found alternatively what we can do inside here let's assume that this is correct we can take this value and place it straight inside the square brackets and do this again this is kind of redundant because we've told it to get the value for key place inside teacher and then we're just going back to the dictionary to get the value twice so make sure if you have an output variable that you actually use it inside here you can see that you're not using it when it goes a slightly dark color like this so just like in the last examples when we were placing values inside our list we can also do that in dictionaries we can say teachers square bracket math and then we can make that equal to something so if the math teacher were to change and now the teacher's called Joel then we can run this line and print out to the screen let's just take that for each Loop and tailor it to the new dictionary and see what happens when we run it so let's just change this into our V to make it simple and then we can have teachers inside here there we go so now let's just run this and see it now it says abber is the first value the abber is coming from console right line here that says teacher this is one line before we change it and we change the value of the math teacher to jaw on the next line and there we go it's committed the change and just like in the last video as well when we try to delete something from the list let's see what we can do to delete it from here so we can have teachers do remove and you can see that it says key in there and again if we add the key in like this then it's going to work just fine there go we just have science we don't have math anymore but if I drop the lowercase then it's going to cause us back with an error but in this case instead of it thrown an exception like it did when we were trying to do up here and up here as well the problem with using the remove is you just simply won't remove it but what it will do is it'll give you back a building if you remember from the last video we actually had a look at a section where in the list it gave you back a booing whether the remove function worked or not alternatively what you could do instead of using the remove function is to check if the item exists in the first place we can say contains key and we can place math inside here and if it does contain it then we can run the same line of code and we can say remove and then use math just to make sure that this is has been actually removed and then in the else we can say math not found retrieving values back should be retrieved using try get just so you don't cause an exception if this is not found we can simply do an update by placing the value of the key inside this square brackets and then simply just assigning it to something else this assignment will change the value of the key which is inside the teacher dictionary and if you wanted to remove something it's best to use the contains key just to check if it contains it first and then you can do the remove and then if it doesn't contain it you can tell the user that math has not been found and then finally we can just print it out like this so in this exercise I want you to create two lists with the integer data type one for even and one for odd and then we're going to Loop through from zero all the way till 20 and if the number is even add it to the even and if the number is odd add it to the odd list and at the end print out all the values for even and for odd I know you can just print these out inside the for Loop we don't have to have dedicated lists but this is just for list practice and I want to talk about different ways that we can do this solution so let's start we can have a list of int and we can say odd new list int and we don't know the size so we're just going to leave the gap empty and if we duplicate this down we can simply just change this to even now the reason why we're doing lists we're going from 0 to 20 of course this 20 value could be anything it could be a million it could be 100 but we don't know and the point is lists have counts whereas arrays have length if we set the array length to something like a thousand we know probably be able to contain all the numbers inside there but that's going to be a lot of positions that we don't exactly need because arrays are not really dynamic because they're static then it's it's best to use list in this case because we don't know how many numbers are going to be odd or are going to be even between this range if we knew the exact number of positions that we needed in a given solution then array would be better since you don't want it to be dynamic if it doesn't need to be so let's start you can have a for Loop that goes from 0o to 20 if you want to include the 20 as well we can just place an equals the best way to determine if a number is odd or even is to use the modulus operator so we can say I percentage 2al equal 0 and what this will do is it'll tell us if I is divisible by two if the value is equal to zero if you have two modulus 2 then the remainder is going to be zero if you have three modulus 2 it's going to be 1 * by 2 which gets you to two and then to go from two to three you actually have one so if you insert an odd number and do a modulus 2 you're going to get a one returned if you do an odd number and you do modulus 2 then you're going to get one returned if you do an even number modulus 2 then you're going to get zero returned so what we can do in here is we can say even do add and then we can simply add I and then in the else we can also simply just do odd do add and then have I because the values of the remainder can only be Zer or one we don't need to have an lse if in here doing this is a little bit redundant although it's still technically correct the values can only either be zero or one so if you run this calculation and the value is zero if you run this calculation and the value zero the only other value can possibly be is one so therefore we don't need additional condition so therefore we don't need this additional condition and we can simply get rid of it if I modulus 2 is equal to0 then we add the number to even and else we add it to odd normally when you have situations like this we can use the conditional operator where we have the question mark followed by the colon but in this case we're actually doing two different assignments we're either assigning into the even or assigning into the odd so there's no room for the conditional operator so at this point we should have all the even and odd values from zero all the way to 20 inside our two lists so then we can now just print both the list out so we can say printing even numbers and then we can have a for each Loop that goes v item inside our even and then we can do a console Right add some inst string interpolation and then we can say item followed by space then we can print environment. new line just to give it some space and we can say printing odd numbers here we go and then we can just take this exact for Loop and copy it down instead of saying in even we want to do in odd and this exactly the same since the variable name is exactly the same let's try run the code there we go it's got zero all the way till 20 and you can see it goes up in twos hence all even numbers and we also get these going up in twos except it starts from one and this covers all of the odd numbers and if we change this number up to something like 50 then the list will just grow and they Cod just still work okay you can see that all of these numbers are still consistently even so now that our task is actually complete let's just have a little recap so the reason why we're using lists and we're not using arrays is for this exact nature if we have 0 to 10 then we can almost work out how many even numbers and how many odd numbers we can have we can manually count we have zero and then 2 4 6 8 and 10 and then for odd we have 1 3 5 7 and 9 so we know how many numbers exist within here but what if we just change that number to 50 then now we have a lot more odd and a lot more even it's impractical to type these numbers in and then to Simply count them in your head and then make an array length based on that position that's a bad solution because not all cases you're going to have the flexibility of Simply typing in the numbers like this and Counting them yourself these numbers could be something that typed in by a user or something loaded for something external like a text file you need to understand that these values can be generated from anywhere and if you just type them in then it provides an unrealistic expectation of how to write some programs so what you have to bear in mind in situations like this is you simply don't know how many even and how many odd numbers will be appearing during this range so you want to use a list so it as dynamic as possible we have two lists in this case one to store all the odd numbers and one to St all the even numbers we don't initialize them with any sort of capacity we just keep it empty for the exact reason we don't use an array we Loop through from zero to anything we don't even have to Lo from zero we can also just start this at 100 and go all the way to th000 it really doesn't matter what our number ranges the only thing that matters is that we have a list that is going to be dynamic and then we can calculate whether the number is odd or even and add it to the right list how this works is we use I which is the number we're currently up to and we calculate the modulus of it to check the remainder if the remainder is zero then it must be even as it's divisible by two and if it's anything else than Z zero which you can only ever be one in this case when using modulus 2 then we add it to the odd list after this followup has run now our odd and even lists have all the values that they should have and we simply just write these two blocks are exactly the same just print the even numbers and print them out print the odd numbers and simply print them out to the screen and that's it and if you run the code it might get a little bit crazy in here but as you can see these will actually work if you pick any random numbers you can see that they're all divisible by two and this same thing goes for odd you can see that they're not divisible to cuz they're all odd so in this exercise we're going to cover a little task I like this call this task an array of multiples so we want to Define initialize two integers and num into length so in the case of this example we have a number seven and the length of five so what this will do is it will essentially give you the seven times table but only the first five numbers 7 14 21 28 and 35 we take the first number which is Nome which will give us the multiples and we take the second number which is the length and that gives us the size of the array so we create the integer array with the size of length Loop through the array and insert the loop count Times by because this is 1 * 7 2 * 7 and so on so forth until we reach the length and we place into the array and then finally we paint the array just to give us these values out to the console all right so let's get started we can have it into norm and make it equal to seven and we have it into length and make that one equal to 5 now the defined initializer two integers let's create the int array with the size length int array result equals new int and we want size length after that we want to create our for Loop now this is the tricky part if we try go from zero all the way to result. length then let's see what happens so we want to start result I you want to make that equal to number which is our array of multiples Times by the value that we're currently up to now let's print our array using for each Loop to see the value so we can say a v item inside our result then we can have a console right that just prints one of them at a time so we can say item followed by spits now let's see what happens when we run it so we get 0 14 21 and 28 and as you can see these are the first four numbers so we're close what we're nearly there because our array starts at zero and it goes to the length which in this case is going to be 0o to less than five which will cover the positions of 0 to four with these positions it's going to do 0 * 7 1 * 7 and then get to 4 * 7 and not actually get to the fifth because we're starting from zero so alternatively what we can do or what you think you can do is change it to a one and changes to equal to so now what it's doing is it's going from one all the way to five which is still covering the same amount of positions it's just one index forward so now if we try to run the code then we get a runtime exception and the reason for for that is it's trying to access position number five if we hover over I we have five and if we hover over the result we actually have some of the right values except it's trying to get to the fifth position and it's not working the reason why the zero index is actually zero is simply because that's the same value as the default value because our for Loop started at in I it's actually only starting from here and going down so this calculation is actually correct but it needs to be back one we need to start the multiplication on IAL 0 but our for Loop needs to start on IAL 1 so we can get all the way through so we have two ways of doing this we could say IUS one so even though it goes from 1 to 5 it's still assigning into the array using 0 to 4 so if we run that we can see that that will give us the desired result alternatively what we can actually do instead of doing IUS one inside here we can define a variable called counter and make it equal to zero we can change this this to counter and we don't need to change the multiplication because that's already going from one to the length which is 1 to 5 in this case after the follow is run we need to remember to increment counter so there we go we have the desired effect another hack if you're interested if you have two variables that you want to increment inside a for Loop you can see that we already have I ++ in here which will increment it by one and we want to increment counter by one as well every single time it loops around what you can actually do is remove this and you know how these are broken up by semicolons that indicates that the section has ended the first section is for declaration the second is for the range and the third is so you can increment the variable or decrement it when you trying to increment two variables inside a for Loop instead of placing a semicolon here and type in the next one you can actually place a comma and do counter Plus+ what that will tell the for Loop is every single time you go through you want to do a series of these actions and because we have i++ and counter Plus+ then that's going to work exactly the same way it just prevents us having counter Plus+ down here and we can move it inside the for Loop just so it doesn't for us and it looks a lot cleaner cuz you can clearly see that every single time we loop around this for loop we're going to increment these two variables there we go so let's try to put some different values in here maybe make this 10 and we can have 10 on both which should give us the first 10 numbers there we go from 10 all the way to 100 let's have a little recap so we're essentially just making an array that will give us back all the multiples so it's like a mini times table but the fact that we're doing it dynamically using our array is quite important what you can do if you wanted to is to extend this program you can ask the user to type these into the console and then convert them and use them right now we're just statically typing them in and that's not really an issue since the main focus was doing this for Loop if you wanted to you could ask the user and you can type these values in so you don't have to change them every single time you compile so now we've got the number and the length let's make our inter the rare call result and initialize it to the length we set up this counter so we simply didn't have to do I minus one here so it looks a little bit more intuitive we start the follow from one and go to the length so we can access 1 to five and the reason why we want to do 1 to five so when we do our multiplication it doesn't start at zero these two are going through the exact same amount of indexes 1 to five is five numbers and 0 to four is also five numbers so when we do our multiplication we want to start from one since the timetable normally starts at one and we go to the length the reason why we're using the counter is so we don't have to do IUS one in here and it breaks up the logic a little bit and it looks nicer with our counter we start our counter at zero and instead of incrementing down here we use this fancy comma and we can say we want to increment I and counter every time the for Loop goes around so we don't need to include the counter increment inside the for Loop and this one line is pretty simple we say result the index of counter which will start at zero which is the start of the array since it's zero base and we say that's equal to the number and the number is going to be a fixed number since this is the multiple and we say number times by I and in this case it goes from one all the way to the lth so we get essentially the times table and at the end we just use a simple for each Loop that will go through all the items inside the result array and just print them out to the screen with a comma after each other using console. WR just so they're all on one line this is the start of the function section functions can also be called method they are used interchangeable in the introduction we discussed dry which means don't repeat yourself and the whole point of dry is so you don't have multiple sections of code that do basically the same thing you want to wrap it around in a function functions are used to improve the readability of your code and the reusability of the code as well having multiple section code that are basically exactly the same can be more prone to errors if you wrap them round and place in One Singular function you can make sure that the error prone and then wherever you use it it will be error prone as well if you have to copy and paste and tweak some code then you're actually exaggerating the amount of errors that could occur and plus it makes your code look a lot cleaner and the structure a lot better since you can name the functions so let's take a little example we have a static void main straight into here this is a function or a method and these are the parameters for the function The NET Framework expects every C program to have a main function with a capital m and it needs to be a static and avoid the parameters don't exactly matter we can also remove them and it won't be a problem the only thing that matters is this needs to be called main if we drop the lowercase on it and try and run the code then we're going to get a build error program does not contain a static main method suitable for an entry point so if you change this back to M and run it again and then it works fine so that's one thing to note about The NET Framework is you need to include the main function otherwise the program won't run and it won't even compile so let's take a look at how we can use this we can have something like a console right line and we can say welcome to my program this is a line that we're probably only going to use once but let's say this is welcome in someone's name welcome AB let's say you had this in your software in many different places you don't want to be recalling this or retyping out this message in case you type it wrong the fifth time and you get a error of course this won't be a syntax or a runtime error it'll just simply be a logic eror because it's a typo so in order to make sure this typo never occurs we can actually make another function so outside of these curly braces and just still within the class we want to create a new function so we want to follow this exact same approach we can say static then viid and we can call it welcome message and we don't need to give it any parameters cuz we're not really going to give it any values just for now now that we've made that we have no syntax errors and we can run it like this except of course there's no body so let's place our console right line within here now if you run the codee nothing is going to happen and the reason for that is the code will still execute in the main we haven't called this function inside the main we've defined it and called it welcome message and we've gave it the contents but we haven't actually made use of it and you can see that when it's highlighted in a darker color that means it's not being used as it says here private member welcome message is on use so now we can simply type in here welcome message followed by an Open Bracket and then a close bracket to denote the parameters that we're going to give it and of course in this case there is no parameters and then we close the brackets and add a semicolon now if you run the code you can see it says welcome abber so just to go over some of these words that we're using static means that we can access it anywhere and everywhere what I mean by that is we don't have the keyword new just before this we don't need to make a new instance of the program class in order to access this so what that means is when we make future programs we're going to have some functions inside our class inside the class you can actually denote if a function is going to be static or it's not going to be static you don't have to specify is it static but this won't let you call it from here because it's unaware where this function is coming from an object reference is required for the non-static field method or property because this is static you need to reference something else from a static nature all static means is you don't have to create a new instance of this thing in order to use it we'll see different examples in the future where you have to create an instance in order to use something so let me just show you quickly if we have a test and I say static void something and we can just print out nothing to the screen and let's try and use this so because this class is outside of the program we have to use the notation test Dot and then it should be available within here and the reason why it's not is because you need to insert this public word just before it and public means everything has access access to it and static means you don't need to create an instance now if I type in the dot again you can see we can now see something and the reason why we can see something is because this is a static now if I remove the static word then you see that we'll get a compile error because it doesn't know where this is now if you don't use static you need to do this you need to say test test equals new test so you make it instance of the class and then inside test then we get the something so that's the difference between static and not static essentially it's accessible from everywhere but if you don't want to be accessible from everywhere then you can just simply remove the static word and the user will have to create a new instance before they can use it so this is what it's like without static and this is what it's like with sty don't worry if you don't understand this too much this was just a quick overview but I have a dedicated video later on in the course so don't worry too much about it so now that we've made a function and we've called it successfully in the main and it's printed out to the console so when we're declaring functions we want to specify what return type we're going to have we have a static void Main in here if you hover over main it says void which means at the end of this function it doesn't return anything hence it's void if you have a look at something like an inter. trass and we open the brackets you can see that it takes in a string and it takes in an integer out parameter it also returns us back with the booing so we can have something like 1 2 3 out in result and then it doesn't actually complain about anything but what we can do is also just store this into to a bu success and then print it out to the screen there we go so it says it was successfully true if we remove this or whether we keep it in or not trip pass function doesn't actually complain but the main point here is it defines back a bu that means at the end of this function it will always return you back with a bull and it's up to you if you want to make use of it and you can alternatively you can place this straight inside the console right line and get the value printed straight to the screen or you could wrap this around inside an if statement like we've done in the past Etc and make use of it that way and have the result being printed out inside here the point is you have functions that return something and functions that don't if you remember that we had the array. copy for example you'll see that they have void here because they just apply a function to something but they don't actually give you something back this is the difference of having something like this a string test that says hello and then you can do test. replace and then you can return you back with the string and it says here it returns a new string whereas when we had a string builder for example and we did string builder. replace you can see that alloy does say it replaces a new string Builder you can type anything inside here and it will still affect the current string Builder it won't have to do SB equals s SP replace as you would need to do here because this returns you back with a new string and if you wanted to replace test you would literally have to say test equals test. replace with something like a string Builder all the array functions you don't actually have to do any of that so you can say array. empty and it'll just return the empty array and the ones that we used before are things like equals and that will give you back a Bool because that's determining whether it's equal or not but if you're doing functions like sort for example and doing things like reverse it just simply applies the data but it doesn't return you back with anything so you can literally just call it inside here put your array in the brackets and it'll use it happily now depending on your user case you need to define whether or not you need to use a return type or not for now let's just cover void which means it won't do anything so let's just Define a function static void create and print an array open the brackets close the brackets and we can have it int numbers make it equal to new int with a l three and let's just have 0 1 and two inside here as the initializer let's just do a for each VAR item inside numbers and then just do a console right string interpolation and just have item Follow by space and now that it's dark gray because we haven't called the function so let's make use of it at the top of our code and let's run it now you can see we get 012 printed to the screen and if we make this into a five and simply just add more values in here and then we run the code you'll see that now it all update but because this doesn't return us back on anything and we don't actually use the integer array outside of these curly braces it's not actually available up here numbers won't be accessible inside here because it's simply not within the scope numbers is only available within this curly brace and this curly brace which means when this function finishes numbers has now been deleted from memory so you can't access it after this line void doesn't do anything it simply just does the contents of the function and as soon as it reaches the bottom that's all that happens you can have another function defined that can return a value like I said with in. trass for example at the end of the function you'll see a word that says something like this it will have return and then return back something followed by a semicolon and that will dictate that as soon as that function is done it's going to give you something back now we're going to cover that in the next video but for now we're only going to cover void functions so we can have something more obvious like a static void welcome message and simply just do a console right line welcome to my program and we don't need to return anything here because all this function will do is simply print out a welcome to the screen and we can use that just before the print array so we can say welcome message Open Bracket close bracket and then a semicolon and hit F5 to run and there we go as you can see our main is really tidy now it gives us function names that tells us exactly what's going on we're creating and printing an array and then then welcoming the user to the console and then having a console read line at the end there isn't an awful lot of void functions all you need to know is that when you create a function you need to give it a return type it returns back a certain data type or it simply just doesn't and depending on what you want to do and what you want to achieve with that function really depends on if you want to return a data type or not in the case of these since they're just doing something and then moving on you don't actually need to return anything by it with in. tripath you want to make the function is executed successfully so when you use in. tripos you can see that returns back a bull and the bull determines whether the conversion has been successful and based on that return value you can determine the next steps of your program if all your function needs to do is provide some sort of functionality and then quit then that's fine and avoid is fine but if you need to provide some functionality and then also return a value then you'll need to specify the data type in here which we'll cover in the next video so far we've covered a void functions but we haven't covered return types void functions are where the function just does something but doesn't actually return anything hence the name void let's start with an example if you have a static void print introduction might want to just return back your name after you've printed this line it's going to print it to the console and that's all it's going to do there we go let's say there's a situation where you actually want to use this inside your code you can actually set the console's title by typing in console. title and type in your name inside the quotation marks or you can type in anything inside here if you run that you'll see Abra is in the title of the console right now and that looks pretty cool what you got to realize is now we have two references to the same value now at this point we can actually do something better we can type in static string name equals abber and then instead of using abber in here we can say name and instead of using abber in here we can also say name and they're both using this variable and if you run the code now you see that the same output will happen you have ABA twice both both in the title and both in the console output now the problem with this approach is you're actually making use of a global variable which we do not like in code in situation like this you shouldn't need to make a global variable because there are ways around it so instead of having this which has a print introduction and we've got the name used in there but the name is coming from here maybe we can use this somewhere else so let's say we make another function called Static and instead of void we want to actually return back a string so we can say string and then we can say my name or something like return name or anything you want just make sure you give it a meaningful name so it dictates what the function is trying to do so this is to return the name and the reason why there's a red underline is it says not all called P return a value since we need to use our keyword return now that we add some empty codes and the return it's going to execute fine and the compil error is gone so obviously we don't want to just return nothing we actually want to take this arber and return in here so let's get rid of our Global variable and let's see what we're going to break so we're going to break these two references to the name variable and simply inside here we can actually just call return name and then here as well we can call return name and what this will do is inside here it will execute this function and then return the value in here if this is too many steps for you you can have a string name equals return name and then simply use the name inside the brackets these two lines are doing exactly the same thing except this is using a variable CU we're starring it first and then we're using it whereas if you place it straight inside the brackets that's just going to store it and use it immediately and there's no additional variable but don't worry too much if you're going to do this notation because an extra variable in this case doesn't really matter because as soon as this function is executed the variable used to run this function gets deleted since it's inside the scope of these two curly braces so now if we run the code you'll see that again we have abber and abber but now what we've done is actually controled everything throughout here so if you want name where to change or maybe this changes in different circumstance based on the user that's logged in then you can simply have the same thing now printed in two different locations in the title and in the console output and it's actually coming from one function so we can have a return name and we can make a static in now can say return age and then we can have simply return 23 and that's our name and our age being returned I change us back to abber and then instead of the print introduction maybe we actually want to print a little bit more than the name then maybe in the title what we can do is have string interpolation wrap the return name and maybe put a hyphen in there and then we can say return age so if run the code now you can see we have ABA hyphen 23 so maybe that's the title of our console but then in the introduction we can use a bit more than that so we can have int age equals return age and then in the console output we can have something like this hello my name is name and my age is age and then after we've compiled that together we can place the output inside here there we go so we're using the name and the age inside the console title and then we have this function that runs to get us back the name and the age and then we're using it using string interpolation of course these four lines can be all squished into one you can simply take this dollar sign let me duplicate this line you can take this and paste it straight into here and while you have name we can have our return name and while you have age you can have return age and that will actually rule out all of these lines and you can wrap it all into one there you go and if age were to change like I said before you can simply type this number in change it and you can see in both cases in the title and in the console output it has officially changed functions can be very helpful to reduce repetition in code let's show you an example if you had three sections where you said enter a number and you had int n one equals convert to in32 and then we add a console. readline and then you had this section and you wanted to do num two and you had this section again and you actually wanted to do num three now at this point even though these three are actually identical you want to be using array in this case so you could have int numbers equals new int Square braet 3 and then here we could say numers zero numbers one numbers two and then we don't need the ins because it's already been defined and then we have them like this but because again all of these three sections are exactly identical we can actually run a for Loop that goes from numbers do length and then we can place one of these straight inside here and then change this to I and now we've achieved exactly the same thing but we're not actually done yet so if you run the code and we do 1 2 3 now we stored all three numbers so we have enter a number and then we have the console read line and maybe we can actually make these two lines a little bit shorter so let's make a function static and because we essentially want to return an integer we can say static int read number from console and then if we take these two lines place them inside here and because we need to return back an integer this is the value that we're going to be returning so instead of assigning this position to something we'll actually just immediately return at this point so instead of doing this line now and instead of doing all of this we can simply make this into one line of code read number from console so every time this will execute it will jump into here print out the value enter a number the user will type it in it will read it in convert it to an integer 32 and this will return back the integer that the user typed in and then that will return it back to the console and essentially replace this so if the user is typed in five then it essentially replace this with five store it loop around and if replaced in 10 the next time and then you replace this with 10 essentially and then that gets started inside and so on and so forth until until all the positions have been complete Let's test that 1 2 3 and it still works okay of course I'm not actually printing the values out to the screen so if you wanted to see that quickly for each can have our item inside our numbers and then do a console right with some string interpolation item followed by a space let's run that one two and three and there we go we get one two and three of course you can make these functions and they can return any bits of data that you want you can even have something like an INT array and we can say create random array and then we can create an array call numbers make that equal to new in square braet 3 and we can actually give it the values of 0 1 and two and then just at the end here we can actually just return numbers and then just in here we can have an INT array and we can call that new numbers since we have numbers above just above here and then we can make that equal to create random array and because this returns us back with an integer array there's no compile arrays inside here and we can have a for each follows the exact same approach as the one above new numbers console right line into a console right and then have item followed by a space now if we print these both out you can see that the zero one and two actually comes from the new one it's just we have two console right right next to each other so there's no new line separating them so if we just add a console right line here one two and three and there you go 1 2 and three comes from the three inputs we just typed in and 0 1 and two actually come from the function we've just created of course if you don't like this notation then what you can do is you make it a lot easier you don't even need to make a new variable you can actually just return the integer just like this so if we place this straight inside here actually just make it on one line just so it looks a bit neater then there you go we have our entire function reduced in one line the goal of functions is to make them do as little as possible if your function has two different things it's doing or more then you should break that out into into another function for example if you had a function that did two distinct operations one was a conversion and one was a calculation then you want to split out into two the first function should be the conversion and the second function should be the calculation and the reason why they're separate is because if you want to reuse them as a pair then you won't be able to reuse each of the pairs if you wanted to have a calculation on its own then you can't do that if both functions do the same thing for example you could have a static and it just could be something let's just call it VI and it could just be test for example and if you had the conversion here and then if you had the calculation in here then you need to split this up into two different functions you want have static void conversion and static void calulation if you wanted to use conversion or calculation separately you can't because now it's in this pair together so if you wanted to use them separately you simply can't it's best to keep functions on the RW anywhere just so they have a single purpose so you can give them a name cuz as you can see here we can't can't give this an appropriate name because it's doing more than one task this is doing the conversion this is doing the calculation and this is doing multiple things this could be doing something if you have to think too hard about the function title then you might be doing too much within each of functions these are very easy to be able to decide what they do cuz this one converts and this one's going to calculate reading number from console if this was reading the number from the console and doing something else then it's going to be a bit of a problem because now you've got a bigger name you don't want to be doing reading number from console and and something else cuz then your function name gets also too big and you got multiple dependencies so best thing to do is to call them accordingly and keep them as short as possible so let's say we wanted to make a function that added two values we can have a static int call it add and then we can return 5 + 5 now this function is a little bit redundant although it will actually work so if we go back to our main and we do a console right line and actually print the value of ADD and we go through our function then we see we get the value of 10 which is indeed 5 + 5 but since this 5 + 5 won't change it's always going to be 5 + 5 this is where parameters will come in which we'll cover in the next videos parameters are a way of being able to give the function value so these two can be actually changed there's no point in having an add function if the only ability you can do is add 5 + 5 because you may as well just return 10 at this point so I covered a lot in this video and there's lots of different functions that do different things of course there is quite a lot of lines we're up to 87 this is probably the biggest project that we've wrote so far and even though this is not really a project it's just a bunch of functions that do little things that are made for demonstrations so let's have a recap so first here we're setting the title as a result of return name and return age we can actually take this and develop this further if you want to we could actually say return name age pair and if you wanted to collapse that inside one function then that could be really easy you could say static string return name age pair and then you can have return and literally the exact same line above you can have return name followed by a hyphen and then you can have a return age and then end the line like that so that just concatenates the two values that are returned from these two functions but the point is you keep them all separate if you were to type in very statically inside here AB 25 then obviously like I've talked about above then you're going to have duplication of data and of course we're going to use this name inside something like here and as you can see this name age pair is actually not applicable when it comes back to this format so it's always best to keep these two separately so if you bring it back and we can actually keep it like this now instead of having this code we can actually say return name age PA now will give us the same value at the top of the code it will have ABA hyphen 25 so that's that bit in our print introduction If We Hold control and we actually press on this function it will actually jump us right down and then if we press the back arrow top left we can go back to it there we go and then click forward so in this function we can break down all of the return values into string variables we have a string name equals return name an inage equals return age then we have a string input that concatenates them both together hello my name is name and my age is age and then we print out to the screen or if you wanted to we could wrap all four of these lines straight up into one we don't need to assign these into variables although it does help the readability if you keep them separate but I prefer to keep it like this since I'm used to this notation we can place return name straight into there which will get rid of our name variable and the same thing with age which will get rid of these two variables and of course we're actually storing the string value before we printing it so we could just take all of this and place it straight instead of here scrolling back to the top this little section was demonstrating how we can use integer arrays to read in all the values from the console but wrap it around in a function so before in here you would would have something like a console right line you'd print out the value to the screen that would say something like a ter number and then you have on the next line a convert to in32 and then after you converted in 32 you'll actually start it straight to numbers but because this is going to be the same thing for inster all the numbers you can actually wrap this around in a function so if we hold control again and go to this you'll see that them two lines are very simply placed in here console right Line enter a new number and then convert in 32 based on the console read line and then we're simply just returning that back ready to be stored in the index of the numbers array and then straight after that we're just printing out all the values to make sure it's worked and that all succeeded fine here I was just demonstrating that you can have different return values and it can literally be anything so as you can see here if you hover over create random array it's inside the program class it's called create random array and it returns back an integer array so that's what we're sign into and if we hold control and click on this again you can see that all this simply does is returns us back back a three length array with 0 1 and two as the array positions and then if we scroll back up when we execute this for each Loop then we're simply going to get 0 1 and two just like that since it's a console right and it'll be on the same line with a space after each other this demonstration was slightly theoretical I was saying in one given situation a function should only do one task if your function converts and does a calculation at the same time then these are actually two different things you should split them so you use the conversion in this step and you use the calculation in this step if you wanted to convert something or calculate something in the future then you can only do it now because we've separated them whereas before if you have them both inside here then you simply can't do one operation because you wrapped it around in one section the same is true when I was discussing this earlier on if we kept this name pair is the only way to access the age in the name then it's going to mess up when we use it in here and then we're going to have a duplication of data but because we separated the name and we separated the age we can use it in this function and we can use it in this function and it doesn't interrupt anything this simply Returns the name this simply Returns the age and these two functions make use of them if we had something else underneath there were another function that depended on the name of the ede then again we can simply use them if it was restricted to this function then it's going to be a problem using it in this function or any future ones and finally just to finish off add function and all it simply does is return 5 + 5 and I was saying as of right now even though it returns back a value it's kind of pointless CU you may as well just return back 10 since it's doing the same thing the reason why included this function is that we can set it up and start planting the seeds to understand why functions exist and how to make use of parameters what a parameter is is it lets you put things Within These brackets so you can give this function some data so if you have an in. trass for example these things that we place ins inside the brackets are actually the parameters so we have a string s and out in something and that's how the parameters work on our Tri pass function and just to show you this is how it's actually wrote It's a Bo and then it's called trip pass and it takes in a string s and out in result then we can make this static and I know it's give us an error because we don't have the control path if we just use result and assign it to zero and then return back true you can see that the compil error is now gone on and as you can see here it says bull trip pass string s out in result and if we actually try and use the trip pass in here and press the brackets you can see that these parameters are exactly identical to parameters that were inside of the tripar coming from the integer Library so in the future we're going to study how we can use parameters to pass data inside our function but just for now know that this function is essentially pointless because it's only going to return back 10 and this function will gain the functionality it needs on when we start adding parameters this should essentially be add five + 5 except this is kind of a pointless function because we already know the value is going to be 10 but again this is just helping you understand why parameters are very essential to functions we've covered how to create a viid function and a function that returns a data type but now we want to create a function that gives it some sort of data you may not realize it but all these functions that you normally use like console right line you're actually inserting data consistently into all of these functions if you hover over console right line you see his void console right line and right now there's an open bracket and there's a close bracket if we delete this bracket and reopen it you see there's 19 different ways you can call this function and as soon as you start to type a string you can see we have a string format and an object if you need to and if you type in another string you can see it says string value this string value is actually a parameter If We Hold control and press on right line you can see all of the different functions right here this is the most basic version that just inserts a right line character to the console and then these are all the different parameters that you can give the value of course you can't double click and view the source code because this is hidden inside Microsoft's libraries the values that are placed inside these parentheses are actually called the parameters this is known as functional overloading which we'll cover later on in the course basically that means you can have the same name function but give it different parameters and you'll see why this is helpful later on down the line so let's close this tab in the top right hand corner and let's bring back out code so now that we've passed hello into this function that's was actually given this a string value parameter and that hello is going to get passed straight into the console right line so then when we run the code it's going to print it to the console so let's create our own function with our own parameters so if we take the function I had last time it was static int add Open Bracket close bracket and it simply returned 5 + 5 which we all know is going to be 10 so if we place add inside these brackets and we run the code we should get 10 return back there we go so of course the this is a little bit pointless since it's always going to be adding 5 + 5 there is no way we can change this without the use of parameters so in here we can actually just do what we do when we normally declare a variable we say the data type int and then the variable name and then if you want to add multiple parameters you can simply add a comma so now we can say int a and int B and you can see now we've got a syntax error because it expects us to have both of these values inside if you hover over it there is no argument given that corresponds to the required formal parameter a and then if we insert a by having five for example and if we hover over it it complains about not having B so we can do comma and then do five again so just this on its own is not actually going to do anything we're actually giving the add function the values of five and five and place them inside a and inside B variables these are now known as local variables and they only exist in memory between these two curly braces as soon as this function is done these are deleted from memory and you can no longer access in a and int B you can't just do something like a inside here and think that this can be used up here these are in two completely different Scopes this is one function and this is another function and they're completely separate from each other when you type in five and five it goes in order so int a is the first one so five gets placed into here and this five gets placed in a b so now that we need to make use of them we can simply change this to a and change this one to B now if we run the Corde we should still get 10 but now our function Works a bit better we can give it a set of d so if we actually just put zeros instead of here then we should get 100 returned perfect so now that we've figured out how to do this let's have a look at different ways that we can make use of this function so let's say we had a situation where we did console right enter a number and we add int nor equals convert to in32 and then converting the console do read line and let's wrap this inside a function so before what I was doing is simply just returning back in int it was static int read int and then we took these two lines and place it straight inside here and remove the fact that we have an integer and simply just change this to a return and what this now will say is let's output enter a number to the console let the user type it in inside the console read line and then read it in convert it to an integer and then give it back to whatever calls it so now we can get rid of this and get rid of this convert and simply just type in read in inside here and after the line let's just print it out to make sure it's worked okay enter a number 10 press enter and we have 10 again and that's fine except if we want to use this in another case for example if you have num one maybe we don't actually want to enter a number maybe this time it's going to be enter an angle or something of this sort so what we can do if we undo that we can actually introduce a string message and what this will do now is actually specify the message that we put in here maybe there's a situation where we always want to enter something so maybe we can just replace this and put a string interpolation and wrap this number around in the curly brace and replace it to message so then in here we can say enter a and then we can pass the string variable which will get placed in here so if this is a number then we can type a number and maybe this is something like an angle and then here we can type an angle so we have 10 enter a number and then there you go it says enter an angle then we can have 100 and that's working as well alternatively if you want to specify the entire message then you can remove these and keep it like this and then in both of these situations we can say enter a number and copy that down like this and make sure you put the colum at the end followed by the space there we go enter a number 10 enter an angle 20 maybe the situation where this text actually changed and you just want it to be angle and if you run that again then you'll see that these are completely different now one says enter a number and one says angle but this gives us a lot of flexibility in what we pass in if we keep it as enter a and then let the user decide on what this section is then you rule out any opportunity to be able to do that option if you wanted to to prevent the colon in the space always being at the end you can actually just add that in manually if we bring back the string interpolation we can say colon followed by space so you don't have to remember to always put that in there we go so that's doing the exact same thing and we're actually just reducing the amount of repetition because we have to remember to put a call on Follow by space inside here we might just forget it and then when you leave it like this then the chord is going to look ugly because it looks like this and it's all stuck together so let's make use of these two functions and let's see if we can write a really basic calculator we can say int first num equals read int and we can say enter first number and then duplicate that down change first to second and then change this also to Second and then inside a console right line we can actually have the add function and we can type in first number and then we can type in second number and if you don't want to call the function inside here you could actually just make another int and we can say int result equals add and just bring this line over to here and then in the console right line you can just print the result there we go so we read in both the values execute the add function and then return it back to the user using a console right line so these are the other ones and then here they are so if we do 50 and we do 50 again and you see that I've messed up because we have double colums now so although our calculator did indeed work let's just go and correct that so we can take these off now because we added it inside here 50 and 25 we should get 75 perfect so now we've made a little basic calculator by simply making use these functions and if we just expand this just to show you what it would have looked like so we go in from this and we place our message inside to here and then we have our convert line just like this and then if we duplicate that down we can change this to second number and then to second number and then as for the result we can say first n plus second n there we go you can see the code is drastically longer and is a bit meaningless to have duplica code this is literally the exact same line in both of these sections except for the fact that this ISS first and this ISS second and we're starring in first and we're starring in second so let's undo that and get back to our more efficient code there we go you can see that these three lines are considerably shorter and easier to read this is telling us we read integer here is the value and we want to return it inside our first Nome and so on and so forth let's have a look at another example where we can make use of this so we can have a string called name and we can read this in from the console console. readline but we need to Output a message so we can have another console right and we can say enter your name and then we can have this twice and we can do enter your age and then have an INT age but of course we don't want to be using this approach and putting a console right line inside here with a convert in 32 because although this is actually technically correct now we're UND doing the point Val function so let's change this into our readint and then as for our message well we have the message right here and again we don't need the space colons let's remove that and then as for the name we can actually do this differently so this is actually going to do a string variable so what we want to do instead of having read in we can have another function called read string another string message parameter and then do exactly the same thing have a console right and we can place string interpolation and place a message inside here followed by callon space and then we can just simply return the console. readline there we go and instead of doing all of this we can actually just put our read string inside here and then place our ENT your name inside here just without the call on Space because we don't need that so now we' reduce this section to two lines as well so now what we can do is have a string details and make that equal to a function that we're going to use now we can say user details if we want to give it the name and give it the age and that will give us back a string that we can print to the console so we can say details so let's go ahead and make use of this function so we can have a static and it's going to return as back a string CU we're placing it inside the string and then it's going to be user details and then our name is a string our age is an INT and then inside here we just want to concatenate them two values together so we can say hello my name is name and my age is age and because that's returning us back with a string we can make use of it inside string details or we can place this straight inside the console right line let's leave it as a function call assign into string details and then print out to the screen let's just skip over these sections enter your name AB enter your age 23 and then there you go hello my name is abber and my age is 23 so this is how we can make use of parameters and inside our functions so we can actually give it some sort of data that's meaningful if you didn't use parameters then what you're going to have to face is for example we showed you with this integer if you don't use parameters then you're going to have situations like I showed you before with this integer function it returns back an integer but it only gave us the value of 5 + 5 I mean technically you don't need to return anything you can actually just keep this avoid and just wrap this around in console right line the only issue with this approach is you don't have any option other than to print out to the screen or if you didn't want to print out to the screen and he simply just wanted to return the calculation and then store it inside another variable this doesn't give you the flexibility of that so we change this into an INT and instead of returning it back to the console we just return back the pure value and then if the user decides that they want to print this out to the screen that's fine like here we've made a decision that we want to print out let's just say we had a variable that said in calculation then we place that inside but we actually never wanted to print it maybe we kept it like this and then use Cal for some something else down below or maybe that was something like storing inside a database not everything will be printed out to the screen for the user to see the best thing to do is return the values in their purus form because you never know what the developer or the user is going to make use of that data later on down the line keeping it it's purus form is the best way possible for example in this case we're actually reading back the integer and then print it out to the screen but in this exact case which is the best case scenario that I just showed you we're actually making use of first n and second n but first n and second n and never actually print it to the screen it's always just used for the calculation if we use console right line to print out first n and second n then we're not going to be able to use it inside our calculation and therefore our very basic calculator is now being rendered pointless so read in and add all return back values that we can use in their purest form and that is the whole goal of parameters so now that we covered parameters that are always going to be required let's have a look at another concept called optional parameters so we had a static int add and we had int a and int B for example and then we simply just returned a plus b like we used in the previous examples if we have an INT result and we want to call that function and we give it the value five and five and then print out to the screen everything runs okay because we've added in exactly what we expect let's say we don't actually have this additional five of course this doesn't make any sense cuz we meant to be adding two numbers but just humor me for a minute then what this will do is says there's no argument given that corresponds to the parameter B now of course this is a problem because it's a red underline which means if we try and run the code we're going to get an issue let's say you creating some sort of system that if you entered both values it uses both values but if you only entered one it automatically set the second value to something else and we can achieve this Behavior using optional parameters so an optional parameter doesn't exactly mean quite optional it kind of just means that it's going to be optional but you can also give it a default value this will always add two numbers A and B even if we make a or b optional it's going to still need two numbers to add in order for the function to run so in order to make a parameter optional let's just say we want to make B optional we can type in equals straight after it and actually give it a value so as you can see our syntax error is now gone and if we run the code we should get 55 and the reason why this works is a is now five if you hover over here we can see a is five and then the square brackets around the int B actually denotes that it's optional and it says int b equals 50 cuz we have that here so it's actually using this as 50 and if we don't specify the second parameter then it's practically just doing this which is completely fine so the reason why I said it's not quite optional is because you still need to give it a value of course in here you can use the default keyword in the case of an integer the default value is actually zero so if you just run that code now it's going to say 5 + 0 which is just 5 so it can be optional but you still need to give it some sort of value of course if you're doing a calculator and you're adding two values if you only specify the first one then adding zero to it is simply not going to change it so zero or default is going to be the best user case when you're dealing with default values with integers so another way you can actually specify this is by inserting this thing called an attribute if we remove this equal zero and just before the end we can type in Open Bracket close bracket and type in optional with a capital O and then you're going to get a red underline if you hover over it it says we need to include this extra Library which will import it at the top of our code as you can see here now that this is available it says indicates that a parameter is optional and what this will do by default is it'll give you the basic value for this number so what I mean by that is we can type in here just to show you this b equals and then B and this will just give you the default value based on the data type and as we just said a minute ago that value is actually going to be zero there you go B is zero so all it's doing is saying 5 + 0 = 5 so that's another way of doing it or you could just leave it as I said before you can say in b equals default or in b equals z it's completely up to you I prefer using the default keyword so you don't have to keep remembering which different data types have the default values in the integer case it's zero but I just like leaving the default and we can get rid of this line now let's have a look at different situations where this be helpful if you had a function called print name and we had a string name in here and then we can simply just say console right line my name is and then name this is quite easy to use so we can say print name and then place arber inside the brackets and then run the code and we get abber printed to the screen and that's fine but let's say if we had someone else's name in there as Joe for example then we get Joe to the screen and let's just say as the developer you only want to default this to abber if you you don't actually insert anything so now if you don't insert anything of course we're going to get a compil error because we need a parameter but if we assume what we did here and just follow the same approach if we use default then it's going to give us nothing because the default value for a string is just empty quot which is just nothing but instead of default we can actually specify value so we can say if no one types their name inside the bracket then use abber there we go so you can have this optional parameter that defaults to something and if someone types in jaw or whatever inside the print name function then the default optional parameter is not going to be used since this will be overridden if you have a parameter placed inside here so now the abber is going to get overridden by the jaw because this is actually the parameter that's being used in the function so you've looked at functions with normal parameters optional parameters and now let's take a look at name parameters so let's say you had a situation where you had string name ABA in age equal 23 and string address equals one something Road and then you had a function that would simply print these details out to the console so start void print details there string name inage String address so you have three console right lines that just print out a name value pair just like this and then when you go to call this function what you're going to have to do is specify the name then the age then the address in that specific order as per the parameter show if we try and run the code now we should get the desired output perfect let's say for example you wanted to rearrange the parameters and put Age first you'll see we have a compiler error now because age and name are in the wrong order string name should be first and int age should be second we can still achieve this by using something called name parameters we don't have to stick to this order if we tell the compiler which parameter we're directly talking about so we can say age callon because our parameter is now called age as you can see it's been being highlighted and then after the call on it's the variables that we're talking about so it just happens to be that age is the same value as the edge so maybe we can change this to age input and place input at the end of these so then we can have age equals age input and name parameter equals the name input and the address parameter equals the address input now we can have it like this and to make it look even better you can actually add new lines in here just to break it off like this and this is a similar pattern that you'll see in normal production code putting a space here can separate them out a little bit and there we go it doesn't matter which order that we put these in right now we can even put address first and it'll still work okay and if we run it you should still get exactly the same output it's just specified in a different way so let's just have a little recap to make use of name parameters you don't need to do anything to the original function you just write it exactly the way you're used to doing you specify the parameters in the order that you think is sensible and when you go to call it you can simply just type in the parameter's name first followed by colon and then the variable name that you want to address once you've done that then you can use name parameters you can go back to using the normal function by just getting rid of the name followed by the colon and just replacing all of the parameters using the correct order and the original variables instead of the new notation having Name colon followed by name input so far we've covered functions with no parameters normal parameters optional parameters named parameters and let's look at a concept called out parameters let's demonstrate a quick example so if we call a function called test and we pass in a value and let's just make this work so we can have an INT Norm equals 0 and then we have a test function so we can say static void test and we can say in Num and inside here let's make num the value of five now in this example if we print out num to the screen what do you think is going to happen is num going to take the value of five or is it going to keep the value zero I'll give you a second to think and let's run the code so let's run it and see what happens and if you guess five you're indeed Incorrect and if you guess zero you are correct and the reason why it's not five is because when you pass a num inside this parameter it just becomes a parameter and therefore it becomes a local variable even though these two variables are actually called exactly the same thing you'll see that when I highlight it it only highlights this one and doesn't highlight this one and the same is true for this it highlights these three references but not the ones down here the gome variable is only accessible in each other scope this one is available through here and here and this one is available through here and here therefore if we use this assignment then it's actually doing nothing if we print out gnome inside here num equals num and then we print that we can see that it is assigned the value five but because it doesn't do anything at the end of this function then it simply doesn't get returned back or anything happens to it so let's see how we can make make this in to five when it gets printed out here so the options that we have is we can actually make this vo an integer and we can say nor equals 5 and then we can return num or alternatively we could simply just return five and not do both of these lines so if we run that now then we still get zero and the reason why we get zero is the test function is being called and it returns back an integer but we're simply not doing anything with it so we can say num equals the return value of this function which will be five and now if we run it we should see our five perfect now this is a little bit cumbersome and let's say you wanted to return a value and return back another value at the same time then what are your options so let me show you a quick example when you're using int. tripod we have a string s an out in result and a bull so what this function is effectively doing is return you back a true or false value to dictate whether or not the conversion has been successful and it's also returned you an out into result and what what this means is you can actually specify integer variable straight inside the brackets so in essence this function has gave you back two values it's gave you back something from the integer parameter and it's also returned back a Boolean variable so let's convert this to code and see what the third option is of trying to return back five over to this so if we just comment out this line and as you saw in the trip pass you simply just need to put the word out just before here out in Num now we don't actually need to return anything in this specific example because we want to just change a num variable using the out parameter but if we wanted to return something separate to the num like a booing like the tri pass did then we have that option so we can return back true but just before we return back true as there's a red underline here it will say that the out parameter gome must be assigned so we need to give num a value we give it the value five because what we're actually doing here even if we double click on this we'll still still get none being selected here cuz the scope is still exactly the same now except what's happening is when this variable gets returned it actually gets put into the variable that it was initially called with so let's fix these compiler errors first so the reason why it's complaining is because we need to give it the out keyword so when we're specifying in Tri pass our first parameter is a string so if the user types in 1 2 3 we put in the first parameter and then we'd say out in result or something along them lines you have an out and then you say you want to make a new integer and you want to call a result see in our case we don't need to put int just like in here because we've already created our num so the only keyword we need is out to follow by space and now of course we're trying to assign this back into an integer which we don't need anymore because this is a booing so we can say bu success equals test out n so we print out Success Print them both the screen now we should have five and true the true comes from the return true and the five comes the num equals 5 so what's actually happening here is we're creating our new integer we're passing it into this function we're also telling you it's going to be an out parameter so this function can still output things to our number variable and then when it gets placed inside here we assign Nome equal to five and then just because we have a bull we have to return true or we can return false of course we can just take this out completely take away the return true and just keep this as test of course in both scenarios these aren actually do anything they're just complete random values it's just made for demonstration so bu is returned back true or false doesn't actually mean anything I was just demonstrating that you can have two return values from one function there we go we get five when we run it just like this so now I've completed this little example let's have a look at how it's used in the real world so before we continue let's see if we can rewrite the tripal function in our code so it's going to be a static returns back a we have a triy pass our first parameter is a string s and our second parameter is out out into result and inside there we can just do result equals to zero and then we can return back true of course we actually need to do conversions inside here if you want this function to work but I'm just showing you for demonstration purpose if we uncomment this line out and have a look at the parameters again you'll see that now they line up perfectly string s out in result and it returns back a Bo which we have exactly the same here there you go bu in. trass string s out in result so that's how this function has been declared of course they're doing something inside the body that can take in the string convert it to an integer place it inside result and then return whether or not the function has been executed successfully so now that we understand how to make an example and how to make the trip pass function ourselves and to give you the Declaration let's have a look at a real world example so if we had a list of string and we had our shopping list that was used from the examples we can have list string and let's just create our own initializer just with coffee and milk inside there we go so now that we've created that we've got our shopping list if you wanted to find something inside the shopping list we have the function index of and what that will do as it says here searches for the specified object and Returns the zero based index of the first occurrence so if we were to search for coffee then we should get return back zero so let's try and run this and put it in the console right line and see what the value is there we go we get zero since it's the first item and if we place milk inside here we should get back one there we go so let's try and rewrite this function into our own code so all this will do is loop around all of the positions until it finds it and it'll find the first one and it'll return us back the index so in this case there's no out parameters but there is a return value so we can also include an out parameter and then instead of assigning the value of minus one we can actually assign the value of true or false to dictate whether or not that we found it so let's write the code normally in here and then let's wrap it around in a function so we can say int index equals minus one because we want it to start a value that we know is incorrect since the lists are from zero onwards the value is only ever minus one then that means it's not in the list then we can then create a for Loop entire equal Z shopping list do count cuz we want to go through every single item inside the shopping list and inside here we want to do a lowercase comparison so we can do if the shopping list square bracket I do to lower do equals and then we want to make that equal to just something that we're going to type in statically so we can just say copy we can make this into a parameter after but this is just for demonstration purposes so we have a bracket and if we found that match then we can say index equals to I cuz the index of the position that we want to find must be up to I cuz that's the one that we've made a match with and we don't need an else inside here we don't need to set an else inside here to make it equal to minus one because if it simply doesn't find it then the index variable won't change its value so it will always stay minus one if it doesn't find anything so after the follow Loop is run let's just print index out to the screen there we go we have zero and if we change this over to milk run it again then we actually have one placed inside here perfect so now what our function is doing is giving us the values of the index if it finds it now if you type in something else if you just add another can let's see what happens then we get minus one and minus one means that it's incorrect and it hasn't found it and what we we can do inside here we can say if the index is greater than minus one then we can say found or else we can say not found so let's run the code now and see if we get a visual representation not found and if we changes back to milk run it again then we get found perfect so as you can see here we're actually checking if the value is greater than minus one but it'd be easier if you had a variable called found and is actually a booing variable so we can make a Bo found and make that equal to and if statement condition so we can say something like index is greater than minus1 which is exactly what we had here a second ago and because this is a condition it's either going to return back true or false and it's going to place the value inside found and then we're going to use found inside here this is easier logic to understand if this is true then it's found if this is not true then it's not found true true false false it's quite really straightforward and very easy and clear you have an index and you have whether not it's being found so let's try and wrap this around inside a function so just as the trip pass does it returns us back with a Bool which in this case will be our found and it also gives us back an integer result but in this case it's going to be our index so let's see what we can do to write this so we can have a static we want to return back the Bo and we can say find in list we need to give it the item we're going to find so we're going to need a string s we need a string s for the item that we're going to find we need to give it the list as well and then finally we need our out int index there we go so let's comment out this code here and let's copy this down into our function and see what we need to do so index has the value of minus one we don't need the integer variable declaration here because we've already declared it inside the parameter so after declaring inside here we give it the value ofus one minus one indicates it hasn't been found since the index are zero based so instead of shopping list we now just have list and list here as well and then instead of having it being equal to milk we actually want to use our s variable and to make it better we can convert it to lower case just so we have lowercase conversions on both sides of the equals if we find a match between the list that we've passed in and the S variable which is our surge term that we've passed in then we assign I to the value of index and then it's still got a red underline because we haven't returned back bu so right now we actually want to return back the found variable so we have two options here we can return back found or we can simply take this and return it back in here we don't need to run this code to see if it's found or not and then store it and then return it after since we're not doing anything else with it we could just return it like this this makes the code considerably shorter because this will just return back a true or false if the index is greater than minus one then it will turn back true if the index is less than minus1 then it will turn back false so let's see how we can use this function inside our code now so we wanted to search for milk so let's just copy and paste this line and let's see if we can get the same output as the shopping list index of so now our function is called finding list you have a bracket and then our string s is going to be our milk our list is our shopping list and our out in index so this is going to return us back with a booing so we can print that booing to the screen and then if we just duplicate that down and we can print index to the screen and maybe using a console right line and just place a space right at the start so we print out whether it's successfully converted or not and we get the value back from it let's run the code so we get true plus the value of one so that means it's found it and it's found it at one index and the previous line before it which just run the normal index of function also return back one so they're both the same let's just get rid of that space so if you change these both to coffee then hopefully we should see the same result but with index zero there we go this zero comes from the index function this true is from our function telling us has been successful and this zero is the index so we can actually take this and put this straight into an if statement so just like we had down here with the found and not found we can say if and then this function call and then we can say found and then the item what we passed in so in this case it's going to be coffee found coffee found coffee at index index and if it hasn't been found then we can just print not found and this is getting an error because we have two indexes up here so let's comment out this line and let's try running out found coffee index zero and you can see these two are the same again one comes from here and one comes from that index we change these both to milk now milk milk and milk then run the code and you see F milk index one if you wanted to just before you pass in here you can ask the user enter an item to search start inside string search equals console. readline and then instead of passing mil in here we can just pass in Search and then instead of passing milk in here we can also use the search variable so now if we try run it again we can type in milk and then we go file milk index one and then coffee found coffee index zero and just to give this a test let's just try and find m not found perfect so let's have a little recap based on this function so initially we tried to assign the value of zero and then print out a normal function and inside test we just had a simple num equals 5 and what this was doing inside is just locally assigning it but not actually return anything and then we said we could assign it and then return it back and that was another option of being able to assign the value to five and then we useed the out parameter which allowed you to pass in an integer when you assign in here it will pass it back into the original call and place it in this variable here so when we print out on the next line it says it's equal to 5 we wrote our own little shopping list for the list of strings and then we called the shopping list function index of and then we actually created our own index of function and made it into a function so just a little recap what's going on here we have a string s which is our search term the list full of the items in the index that we're going to pass back to the user as well as returning back a bu to indicate whether we found found it or not we set the index to minus one so then that completes our logic at the bottom minus one means it hasn't been found since the list is all zero based if this value is greater than minus1 then that means that we found it inside the list since the list is zero Bas and if it's not that and this returns back false then we mustn't have found it because this line would have executed so we Loop through the list we do a lowercase comparison on both sides of the equation on the list item and on the sege term if they both match we run the index and stall the I variable inside the index and then we return whether index is greater than minus one so after we've turned this back from the end of the function we can see once we run it inside the console right Line This is just going to return us back with a true or false value as well as creating our new integer variable called index so on the next line we can use index and print out of the screen this line should return true or false since it's a Boolean return and this variable will either give us minus one or something above minus1 but in this case when we actually make use of the function we can ask a user to enter something get them to type it in and pass that into the function but more importantly when this function returns if it's true we output it's been found and if it's false we output not found and we only make use of this integer variable should this return back true there is no point in printing minus one to this screen because that's what you're going to get if it's not found it's going to look something like this which is kind of redundant because the user doesn't care about this so we don't need to include it when we're printing not found but we should include it when we're printing out the found of course this is just a random example and you might not need to print it out to the screen or you might just do something else inside here you might be searching for something and then you might want to edit it or do something else with it and then you can make use of that index if you wanted to ask the user to search for an item and then tell them what they want to replace it with then you can also do that just as we've covered in the last examples so after after we've covered out parameters and normal parameters let's have a look at a concept called passing by reference so we created interm equals 10 and let's call it assign and we passed it straight into here and we can have a static void assign in N if we say Nome equals 20 if we use a console right line up here then Nome is still going to be 10 because we're not returning it and we're not really affecting it now other ways we can do this is by changing this into an INT and then we can say return 20 and then we don't really need this anymore so we could just say num num equals a sign and then we'll get 20 assign back in there we go or we can actually make this an out into num and then we can say num equals to 20 and then inside here we can say out num we don't need to return back in anymore so we can make this Vol and you see the value 20 so there are different ways that we can assign a variable straight from here so let's let's have a look at another method so instead of having out we can actually use a new keyw called ref and the reason why it's ref it means it's passing it by reference so when you pass a value in through a parameter normally you're actually passing by value and what that means is you're copying this value that gets passed inside the brackets into here and it's making a whole new variable what I mean by that is this might have memory dress location one and then when this variable gets created it has memory dress location 2 for example and then it's used within here and then two is now deleted because you've got rid of the variable because of this function but one is still alive since in the main function when you pass by reference what you're doing is you're saying give me the memory address location of the variable inside the brackets and give it into this function rather than copying the value so if this has memory just location one and you pass it into here then it's also going to have one so what this actually means is if we put this ref keyword just before the in just like we do with the out and we can place it here as well we're now saying we want to pass this by by reference so when this 10 gets passed in here we actually have a link if you will to this gome is now linked to this gome which means if we simply do n equals 20 and run the code then we're going to see 20 the main differences between reference and using the out keyword is when you're using out within a function you actually need to make use of the value if I don't include anything within here then I'm going to get exception and it says the out parameter num must be assigned so when using the out keyword num has to be assigned when using the ref keyword you don't have to make any assignment because we're just passing a reference in with the out keyword you literally tell the function I want to Output this value but if you haven't gave it a value to Output then of course it's going to be an error so we can assign in the reference if we really want to but you don't have to and it's not required so there are the two main differences between passing by reference and passing by value and also using the out parameter passing by reference is technically quicker because of efficiency when you don't pass it by reference you pass it by value which means it'll essentially place that 10 inside these brackets instead of passing the variable in it actually just passes the value and then it makes a whole new variable down here when you pass it in by reference you're essentially actually giving it a link to this memory address location from inside this function which means that you don't actually have another local variable inside here because this one is affecting this one directly you can do this with any amount of references you want by simply just changing them and adding another one in like that for example and then we can have a string name and then we can pass our ref name inside here and inside here we can say name equals hour and this doesn't like it if it's unassigned so we just give it empty quotes or we can sign it another name it doesn't really matter it's just a demonstration and if you run that but let's just print out the name as well to the screen there we go we get Abra assigned into there and same thing with this variable is we're actually just passing in the variable as a reference rather than as a value it doesn't matter what the value is going to be CU it's just given this variable inside this function so we're actually saying name equals we'll basically just assign it back into the original variable so let's just have a look at another example so we can have some sort of like change name function and we can give it the name variable as a reference and then we can give it the new name that we're going to pass in in a second so if we make a new function static void change name you're going to need a ref string name and a string new name and we can simply say in here name equals new name perfect so let's give this a shot so if we just comment out this little section and we can say console right enter your new name then we have a string new name equals console. readline and then just up here as we've done before we could just declare the name as being Joe and then we enter the new name call this function and then after we can say your new name is and then we can pass in name perfect let's run that so at this point the name is actually Joe cuz we've made it appear and then we'll enter a new name so we can type in abber now it says your new name is abber perfect so all this function is doing I know it's pretty pointless right now cuz it's just doing one line but all it's doing is assigning the reference to the variable that we pass in so what we can do now is make sure that we can actually assign this variable in and we can also pass in a Boolean variable so what we should do now is actually make sure that we can do the assignment properly cuz you don't want to assign it if the value is empty and then return back a booing type just to indicate whether or not it's being assigned so what we can do in here is just on the change name we can wrap this around an if statement and if this returns back true then your name has been changed and if not we can say console right Line new name cannot be empty or no in order to be able to do this check as we've used before we could say if new name and then just around that we can say string do is n or empty and wrap that inside the brackets and we want to say if it's not n or empty then we want to do our assignment after we've done our assignment we can return back true inside here and then just outside we can return back false notice how in this little bit of code we actually don't have an else we don't need to write else inside here and place return false inside here because if this returns back true then it's going to execute this one line return back true and since it's a return it's going to jump to the end of the function so we don't need the else in there because the only way that this line will ever execute is if we actually had this function returning back false so if this returns back true it's going to hit this line hit the return jump to the end if this returns back false it's going to skip over the if statement and then just return back false to the user perfect so now we've got no compile errors let's give it a run so we want to change your name to nothing if we just press enter then we can see it says says new name cannot be empty or no and if we type something in then we get our name changed so just to round up this video let's talk about the main differences between the ref parameter and the out parameter when you sign in by reference you actually have to make the variable before you pass it in for example you can't just write ref string in here and that actually works whereas you can't actually do that with the end let me demonstrate so if you had the in. trass and that has an out parameter you can actually type out in index inside here you don't actually have to make the int index inside here and then specify it outside you could just initialize and declare the variable straight inside the brackets whereas because you're passing a reference with the string you actually need to make the string first and then pass it in so that's a big difference between the out and the ref when you make use of it actually inside the function if you're using a reference then you never have to assign it or at least it's not required you could have a series of if statements inside this body and then you might determine that you might not need to assign it which is exactly what we've got here the only way we assign name is if this returns back true if it doesn't return back true then we simply don't assign it and move to here this is a problem if the out variable if we change it to an out then we're going to get a compiler error because it doesn't return back a value so we'd have to write something like this at the top name equals something and then potentially sign it here and then return back false so with reference you don't have to worry about the fact that you might not assign in every single path of your code and finally the main difference is the fact that out parameters are still used by value and this is by reference reference will be slightly quicker since you'll get the memory just location being passed in instead of the values so you won't have two copies of the same variable the focus of this task is to create a function that calculates the area of a triangle so we're going to ask the user for width and height install them both create a function to calculate the area the function is going to calculate it using width times by height taking that calculation and dividing the value by two call it in the main and print out the area of the triangle to the screen so let's start with entering the width and the height so we can say enter width callon and have int width equals convert to int 32 console do read line and if you copy these down change width to height and change width here to height and just before we continue because we did copy and paste down then this is quite bad and we should use a function here so in both of the cases we're going to output something to the console and then read it in and convert it back as an integer so we it says static int because we return back an integer so we can store it we can say read int and we want a string message so we can pass in this value inside here so we take these two lines and place inside here instead of enter height we're now going to have message instead of int height we're just going to have a return value and then we're ret return in the conversion from the console read line and now we can use it inside here read in and inside inside the brackets you want to put the string output which is going to be enter height if you paste that inside here and then do the same thing for the previous section and change height to width and now get rid of these so we just have these two lines perfect so let's just print these out to the screen on separate lines just to make sure it's working see the width of 10 and height of 15 we get 10 and 15 Perfect Since that's working okay we can now create a function that can calculate the area forward so we can get static int Cal area and we can have int width and in height and then taking this formula we can simply just do return bracket width times by height / two as you can see this is literally exactly the same as what we've got here it's crucial to include the brackets because we want to do this calculation first take the value of that and divide it by two if this is too many steps you can actually break it down we can say in calculation is equal to to the width times by the height and then we can simply return calculation / two back to the function it's slightly grayed out because we haven't use it but that's not a problem we're going to use it now I personally just to prefer is to keep that inside here and just have the brackets since a bit more obvious to me what's going on but it's up to you as the programmer either way it makes no difference it's just more for the programmer's convenience so now we need to call the function above so we can say in result equals calc area and then pass in the width and pass in the height and then we can have console right line that just says the area is and then result and then let's run it so you have 10 and 15 and there we go we get the area is 75 perfect if you didn't want to call the function inside here and St it inside a variable you could just output this straight to the screen by placing the function calls straight in the cly braces and if you run that again just to make sure 105 and we get 75 again perfect so just a quick little recap we have the console right plus the convert inside this function which will let us return is back an integer and we can pass in the message straight in the variable to make this a little bit quicker and a bit easier you can actually just change this one word inside here so you could actually say enter message call on space and then just inside here you can say height and just inside this one you can say width just to reduce on code because in this specific case the only thing that changes between them two string variables was the fact that one was width and one was height there we go you can see it's exactly the same now so after we read in these two variables we pass it into the function and all the function will do is take width and height times them both together take that value and divide it by two and return it back to the user and then we can call it straight in here the area is calc area and pass in width and height in this task we're going to create a function that will return us back with the sum of numbers inside an integer array so first step is to create an initialize an array of numbers create the function with the int return type and it also takes a int array as a parameter the function should return a total of all the numbers inside the interray call in the main output the total and just for extra bonus points inside the function instead of using a for Loop immediately you can check if the array length is greater than zero and then return minus one if it's empty and then check that inside the main and then output a specific message and also see if you can think of any other implementations you can use instead of having to do return minus one how else can you make this function whether that means you have to change the parameters of return type or anything like that just have a think about the situation and see what other options you can make of course the output at the end is still going to be the same but it's the way you do it and the problem solving skills that I'm trying to get you to get used to let's get started so let's create initialize an array of numbers so you have int numbers equals new int and let's just allocate them manually 1 2 3 4 5 and add a semicolon there we go now let's create the function sum of numbers and we want it to return integer back with the total then we want to take an in Array called numbers and then inside here we need to actually return back an INT so we can create an in total make that equal to zero and at the end we can return total and then during the middle we're going to have to write our for Loop so we can go through the integer array and count through everything so we can use a for each V item inside our numbers and just inside here we can say total plus equals item perfect so if we can call in here we can have a console right line and we can just say sum of numbers and pass our numbers array in the parameters so we're just going to Output it to the screen just for the time being so sum of values from zero all the way till 5 is 15 perfect so now that we've done that we've created a function that Returns the total numbers call it in the main output the total so we can just say the total the total is and then wrap this around in the C brace there we go the total is 15 now with the extra points we can check the ray length and return minus one if if the array is empty so let's see what we can do in here before we even end up going inside anything to do with the total we can wrap this around in if statement that says if the numbers do length is greater than zero then we can proceed with this little section so if we highlight all of this hold alt and press upar key then because it's one back just press tab ones and just press the delete key here and let's get rid of the empty Line This is going to return us back with an error because not all code path return a value if this returns back true then we'll eventually hit a return but if this return Z false then we not do anything inside here so let's have a look at our requirements return minus one if the array is empty this dictates whether the rray is empty so if this returns back false then it's going to come into here and we can say return minus one so we've got this function call in here we don't want to print the total right now because we want to make sure that this total is actually greater than zero because we don't want to make a sum of the numbers if the array is empty so if you run this right now going to get the total is 15 and if we get rid of all these variables and just have the length of five but not give it any value so all the values are going to be zero then if we still run that then the total is going to be zero but that's still an acceptable value because that's actually got values inside but if you said the array length is zero then the total is minus one of course we don't want the user to see minus one so we want to bring this back and instead of calling the function immediately down here let's call it here we can say int result is equal to this and then we can say if the result is greater than minus one then we can output the total and again press into this line hold alt and press Arrow key and then we can place the result inside here and the L's to this will be canot add up and empty aray there we go so now if you run it we should still see 15 but if we get rid of this and put it back to zero there we go we cannot add an empty array so we bring that back perfect so now if we check this we've got check in the main output the message and then now we've got this little solution do we need to return minus one how else can we make this so right now we're going to have to return back minus one cuz that's the only way that we can tell the user whether or not it's been successful if the ray is empty we return minus one and if the ray is not empty then we return something greater than minus one which will be something above zero or Zer itself but as long as it's greater than minus one that's how we know it's complete but we don't actually want to do this we want to be ideally returning back a Boolean so let's duplicate this function and show you both implementations let's change this into a and then because we're still going to need to reference the total we're going to have an out in total so we need to change up a few things inside here instead of this return minus one we can do return false to indicate that it hasn't been successful instead of returning back total we can actually just return back true now we haven't done everything yet we don't need to redeclare in total inside because we already declared it inside here so we could just initialize total to equal to zero but the problem here is if we make total equal to zero just within this path then it's still going to complain that total must be assigned so we can take this and just assign it right at the start of the function just like that there we go so we make total equal to zero that gets rid of the compil errors and gives it a value the reason why we have to give it a value is because this out in parameter doesn't like it if you don't assign the value that is a requirement for using the out parameter so make total equal to zero check the numbers length If This Were to return back false then we return false to indicate that we can't do anything if this returns back true it will go through and count all of the items place inside total and then return back true so let's have a look and see what else we can write this little section of code so instead of having to call inside here and use it within there then we can actually do this another way the reason why we actually calling this straight inside here is because we can't place this straight into here since it returns returns us back with an integer and now that is actually fine if that returns back with integer cuz as you can see there's no problems here the issue arises is when we have our result variable we can use it inside the bracket and down here there's no point in calling this twice to get the same value although this would still technically work but this is not really efficient since you calling the function twice it's best to call it once store the value and then make use of it twice when we use our out parameter you'll see that this gets a bit easier so straight inside the if statement we can say sum of numbers and then we can pass in our numbers and then space out into total and what that'll do now is because this returns us back with the bull we don't need any additional conditions like we have one here cuz this will turn us back with a true or false true if it succeeds false if it doesn't so we don't need to say if it's greater than minus one because we don't actually care about the value of the total right now we just care if this returns back with true or false so inside here we can take this same output message and instead of having result here we can have total and then we can take this exact L statement and place it here and let's see what happens now the total is 15 and the total is 15 so they're both return back the same values let's add something else on here just to make sure it works there we go so you can see that both these Solutions look very identical but one is considerably different we have to make a variable outside use inside here and use inside here whereas in this function we can actually just call the function straight inside that will process our new out into total and then we can simply use total inside here and we don't have to require another additional variable just outside here as this one will and you can see that the functions is a little bit better because we're returning true and returning false to indicate whether or not it's been successful whereas in this solution we have to return back an arbitrary value and then check that in the console the reason with returning minus one is kind of a problem is what if these numbers are actually all negative then this value is going to be very bad this can only read work if all of these values are positive if you had negatives for all of these and we tried running the code there you go this is a major issue cannot add up an empty array well it's not the fact that it is empty it's the fact that these values are smaller than minus one so you don't actually want to be going with something like this approach where you're comparing the value because you don't know what numbers are going to be typed into here if the user were type in positive or negative you want to provide a solution just like this one that works for either positive or negative you don't want to restrict that by checking if it's greater than minus one will only works if all of these are positive values all this is an index for the array since arrays start at zero and go upwards you can't have a negative -1 array position but in terms of numbers that are randomly typed inside of a ray you should always be wary of using this option because if some of them are negative then this could return back false so let's just have a quick recap so we have an integer array we have our values initialized down here and then the first solution we call the function pass in the numbers array get our result back check if it's greater than minus one then that means it's been successful so we print it out and else we tell it it's an empty array now second option we actually call the function because it returns back a booly in this case so we can place it straight inside the if statement and then we can pass in the numbers array and then we have it out in total which will give us the total and in this case we don't need to check the value because this returns us back with the true or false and in this case true determines whether it's been successful and false it doesn't if it returns back true then it has some values inside the numbers array that we can actually add up and if it returns back false then that means the array is empty so let's have a look at the implementations so without the out parameters this is the first solution up here we get the numbers length check if it's greater than zero if it's not we return minus one make a new variable called total make equal to zero and we run a for each Loop of our item inside the numbers and we just say total plus equals item add them all up in the for Loop and simply return the total and then in the out solution we have a total equals zero which just initializes this variable otherwise we'll get a compile error then we can say if the numbers is greater than zero then we can say if numbers. length is greater than zero then we can do the for Loop and return back true and if this turn back false then we can say false inside here and then when we use it straight in the brackets we have access to it straight away since it uses a Boolean variable and then our value will be placed inside our out into total parameter which is used down here for the output to the screen and again if this returns back false then it will say cannot add up an empty array and then we hit the console read line and way at the end there we go that covers everything inside here exceptions are used to prevent your code from crashing and then the program closes down let's have a look at a very very common example let's have a console right and we can say enter a number and then we can use int Norm equals convert to int 32 and then we can have a console. readline inside here and let's just print out number to the screen now if we assume everything goes well and we actually enter an integer like 15 and we press enter then we simply get 15 returned and as we saw in the past when we covered the trass function if you enter anything else that's not exactly a number then you get again exception exception unhandled unhandled means that we haven't wrote anything specific that will handle this exception so it's causing the program to close it's a system. format exception it says the input string was not in a correct format so this is a format exception because we've entered in a very weird set of characters that can't be converted over to an integer so now our program is forced to crash and now rest of our code is going to be deleted now because it won't be able to run so if you had any important data that was stored just before this point then it is now lost this is very crucial because if you have a system that rides to a database or it stores some very important information that someone's typed in you want to handle the exceptions so if something were to arise it doesn't actually close the program down and they lose all of their data I'm sure you've had it in the past where you've tried to do something and the program comes up in Windows and it says this program had to stop responding when that normally comes up it means that Something's Happened that's so fatal that the program cannot continue it has to crash down and in most cases this is what's called an exception so if we run this code again let's have a look and see what else we can do to make this code break so of course as you heard before a num integer can only survive up to about 2 billion numbers so if we enter a number bigger than that let's see what happens then we get an overflow exception value is either too large or too small for an in32 of course this number is very big and only a long would handle something like this an integer definitely won't so these are the kind of exceptions where you'd have to handle it yourself manually otherwise your program is going to crash coming up next we're going to go through the ways that we can handle these and make sure programs don't come to a halt exactly like these examples I want to explore a technique called TR catch this is very similar to when we use the int. trass what this essentially does is it tries to do something and it lets you know if something went wrong this is exactly the same when we're dealing with exceptions except when we're doing a try catch what the catch means is catching the exceptions that happen and therefore it is now a handled exception instead of unhandled exception so before we try and fix how this works let's just explore the syntax so we can type in try followed by curly brace and just after this curly brace we can say catch then we're going to put something inside the brackets and then we have an opens brackets if you wanted a quick shortcut to this just like we've done the for Loop and we double tap tab we can actually delete this so you can type in try and press tab twice and then you get try the Open brackets you get the exception and then we get throw so let's get rid of this and what we can do right now is we can actually place the Corde that we want inside here inside this Tri bit because we're telling the compiler that we want to try to do the things inside here and then we want to catch these things so inside these brackets what you want to actually do is decide what thing that you want to catch if you type in exception this will catch every single exception now the problem with that is you'll actually face some difficulties when you're trying to Output very very specific messages so as we've said before when you type in a value too large you get an overflow exception but when you type a value that can't be converted like a square bracket then you get an input format exception so first what you actually want to do is run this code outside the try and let's run it now and let's get them bad values so we had the square brackets and we can get this and let's copy it down and place inside a comment just like this and then let's rerun it and if you type a number too big take this stop the program and put it inside here so now that you know what the exceptions are called we can actually write write these inside the code so we have a form exception and an overflow exception but before we get into these specific exceptions let's just catch everything this is just a catch all and then see how this works so as we've put it back inside here let's see what actually happens so we can just put a console right on here and say something has went wrong the reason why something has went wrong is because this is a catch all any exception appears during this code it will always come into here regardless of what the exception is whether it's a format or an overflow it doesn't matter it will always come into here so it's going to be something because this is not specific at all so let's run the code enter very big number something has went wrong but if you notice how the program doesn't actually clash it's still very much alive and we can test this by putting a simple message here at the end that says goodbye and we run it again enter a big number and there you go we get the message as goodbye so it successfully skipped over this section without actually causing an exception that breaks the program so even though we've entered something very fatle because we've handled it then there's no problems so if we now type the other one where we have the square brackets then you'll see we'll also get something has went wrong so if you wanted to catch a very specific exception what we can do is say catch open the brackets and we can say format exception just like it says above here and then place the curry braces and what you can do now is you can actually chain these and these go from top to bottom when an exception occurs up here it will match this one if it doesn't match it will match this one and you want to put the catch all right at the end so if it doesn't match any of the ones above it it will always match the last one so you can have a generic message inside here but you can have a very specific message inside here because it's a format exception you can say please only enter numbers so now if we run the code and if we type in square brackets it'll say please only enter numbers there we go so this is a very specific example and if we copy and paste this down again and then we can say overl exception and we can say please enter a number less than 2 billion if you enter a very big number again please enter a number that's less than 2 billion perfect so this will get checked like if statements it will start on the first one and go down the list imagine this is a if and then we have an lse if and then lse if as well if you place this one right at the start then you're actually going to get compile errors and you can't actually have the catch all right at the start so even if you wanted to the compiler literally doesn't let you and anyway you don't really want to be doing that because then you'll be ruling out these two and it's kind of pointless writing this code if it's never going to get used anyway so now when we run the Corde you can see even if we type in a bad value our program will still run and everything works okay so now what we can do is actually make this into a real life situation so if we actually type in 10.2 that it says please only enter numbers then we're going to have an issue here because if we try and print the value down here then it's going to cause a problem let's try and print out num and you can see that num does not exist now we have an issue of scope int is only declared within here and here so if you wanted to print out the value of gome we'd have to print it out up here so now let's run it again and if we enter 20 20 comes up if we've entered 15.5 then actually skips over this console right line because the exception occurs right here and then it'll jump into one of these paths so in order to store the value of num you can either move num outside here and make it equal to zero and then assign num inside here and then you can take this console right line and actually put it right after the triy pass but I don't really suggest this option so if you said 15.5 then you're just going to get zero returned but we don't really care about the zero because we're not going to get the value converted so why do we need to print the zero and the answer is we don't so what we should do is keep it all inside here again and then what we should do instead is wrap this around in a while loop so this will try to do the code this section will catch them all and then we simply have a good buy at the end but let's just make sure that this actually runs because if we type in 15.5 then the user still hasn't entered the number but our program is closed so we want to loop around until the user has success successfully enter a correct number so we can say bull looping equals true and we can have while the chord is looping then we can have the curly braces let's place our entire Tri cut inside here if we highlight it all hold alt and press the op power key and then tab it once and then get rid of this empty line so now we'll keep looping around here until this is going to be a different value so because the while loop will only keep looping until this is true and the moment when it's false is when it will cancel while loop so as I said before it when we run this code and then just at this specific line if the exception occurs it will actually skip this line and jumped below here so if it ski this line then what we can actually do is we know if it reaches this line then the conversion is been successful so we can print out to the screen and we can say looping equals false and we don't need to place looping is equal to True inside all of these three paths because if we don't assign it to true then it's still going to be the value false no matter how many times you loop around so let's try and run that now enter a number 15.5 enter a number 15 and we can keep doing this forever as it's a while loop and as soon as we enter a valid character 20 and now it says goodbye because we hit the end of the program so that's it for this video but let's just have a little recap so we've determined when we run our code just these two lines that in both situations we can have a format exception and it all overflow exception we can use these to catch them specific exceptions and then have a catch all at the end the reason why you want to catch multiple is you can have a very specific message overflow dictates we have a number that's too big or too small to fit inside of an integer it can be less than -2 billion or can be greater than 2 billion and that's how you get the Overflow exception we get him a format exception if you entered something that's literally not a number or something that has decimal places and then I'll catch all can be if anything else goes wrong we can output a generic message but in 99% of the cases you'll either enter a number too big or too small or it's in the wrong format and this exception is just so it catches everything else should anything else happen so at this point even though our program doesn't actually close and there's no exceptions the user hasn't had a chance to enter the number again so we use this inside a while loop and we can say while looping is true when we hit a conversion that's successful we say looping is equal to false and once it hits this line the Y Loop will then exit and then we'll get our good goodbye message and we wrap the entire TR catch inside the W Loop just so this keeps on looping until the user has typed in a successful value as demonstrated above we can type all this and 15.2 15 Point 15 and then finally says 15 and then goodbye so I want to explore different ways you can output messages inside this catch block when you have a catch exception this is actually a parameter that we're passing in this parameter can actually have a variable as well normally when you specify parameters in a function form you say int and then something whereas right now we're kind of defining the data type which is our exception in the same case as in in here but we're actually not giving it a name so it looks something like this of course when we do this inside a function we're going to get a syntax error but for a catch we're not going to get any errors at all and the reason is because we can catch without having to use a local variable so we actually add a local variable make you call it e for exception then we actually have lots of options inside here Type e then we have lots of data and the stack Trace is very helpful when you debuging but we'll cover that at a later date the thing I want to focus on right now is the message so we can use this and print out to the screen so we can say error callon and then type in E message and let's run that now if you enter something invalid input string was not in a correct format if you enter big number then value is either too large or too small for an in32 as you can see these error messages are pretty descriptive and normal users should be able to read this and understand it of course if you want this error message to be more specific then you can add some more catches inside here and we can have format exception this will be if you type in something other than number but if you do exactly the same thing in here then it's kind of redundant because you're just outputting exactly the same value if we try to put the square brackets again then we're going to get this this string which is actually outputed from this line but even if we include the catch all exception you get exactly the same error message outputed from here the moral of the story is you should always have a catch all right at the end of your chain but if the only thing you're going to do inside here is simply output this message to the screen then you don't need any multiple catches what you should do is catch multiple exceptions that you know are going to get fired in your code and then you want to handle them and then have a catch all at the bottom that will display the message generically instead of displaying the message right here you can actually have a more specific message like we covered in the last video so this could be please only enter numbers and we don't actually need the message in this case because we know what exception we're going to catch because we've specified format exception another little tip if you hover over the function call it says here format exception and overfall exception which is the two that we handled in the previous video this is very easy and understandable if you can just read the values from here into see what exceptions can get raised and the same thing here you get an IO exception for the console right line the console right can also give back an IO exception as well generally speaking these console functions almost never return back exceptions I don't think I've ever hit a situation where this exception has been returned unless you do something ridiculous and maybe you type in way too many values that the console right line can handle let's try an example and we can do something like this if you enter a very big number that can't be specified inside an integer then console right line has so many overloads that it actually processes it as a long right now so you almost can't break this unless something fundamental to your computer actually happens so you have exception e and with exception e you can actually take this local variable and print out the message this is the preferred pattern because instead of outputting here something went wrong just very generically you can actually give them the error message that comes back from the exception the reason why this is helpful is because if it doesn't hit any of these exceptions and it just happens to fall into the catch all at least the user has an idea of what the error message is going to be the preferred option is to try get to a point where you never have to reach the catch all and try chain as many catches as you can in order to handle as many exceptions based on the code that you're writing which can be found if you hover over the function and read the exceptions once you've covered as many options as you can throughout the catches then you almost never have to worry about the code entering this section because we've covered both the exceptions in format and overflow and we can do overflow right now please enter a value under 2 billion then that means we've actually covered all of the catches that are to do with converting in integer 32 covered format and covered overflow so when we run this code the only two things that can possibly go wrong are these two functions the format exception overflow exception and we won't ever hit the catch all in this case but if anything goes wrong at least we have a belt and Brace option to catch it and we can tell the user what happened and because it's e. message then the value is going to be quite descriptive so the user can read it without any problems so in this task we want to be able to convert a string to an in successfully without any errors occurring and without any exceptions that could break our code so in steps we want to create an INT and try and convert any string from the console to an integer notice the error that appears when you try to do that write a try catch Handler around it to successfully operate that and output the message to the screen and you won't need to change the console out print and convert in 32 to be able to make this work so you don't want to change the current code you just want to add the Trion Handler around it so why is this a bad situation how can we know if it's been converted this is just a question that you should keep at the back of your head and we'll answer this shortly and then finally we want to create a custom trip pass function find the real trip pass function and copy the return Titan parameters and see if you can mimic Its Behavior read the tool tip it gives you to give you ideas on what to do so let's take these in steps first first we can have a console right and say enter a number and then int num equals convert to in 32 and then we need a console read line and then if you run the code if we try and just convert some square brackets then we get a format exception so that's the exception that we're going to be handling right now so we can take this code and we can wrap it around in a try use alt and up Arrow key and then just have to do a c and then we want to do a format exception and then space e to give it a variable and then we do e. message out to the screen and now let's run the code square brackets input string was not in a correct format so we get our message and our exception has been successfully handled and our program hasn't crutched but the problem is is has got to this console read line and the user hasn't had a chance to actually enter a number so what we can do in here to ensure the user always has access to writing a number is we can say something like this bu success equals false and then just after here we can say success equals the true and just down here we can say console right line success question mark yay and then call on or no so if it convert it 15 we should get a yay and if we convert it and it fails then we should get an o no along with the message of course what you can also do is wrap this entire section inside a y Loop what we've already covered that inside the tutorial and that means we keep repeating this until this is set to true and therefore exit the while loop and then will the users finally typed in a number so let's go back so we've noticed an error and we've wrot a tri catch handle around it now we want to catch the error and output the error message with through done and then we haven't changed the current code which was these two lines we've added a the booing and set it to True here just so we can have a bit of an output message before so why is this a bad situation how can we know if it's being converted so this code is a bad situation because we just have these two lines outputed and then now that you've added our booing to tell the user whether it's been successful or not is actually making it a bit more meaningful the problem is even if we print or no then the user doesn't really have a chance to enter it again so like I said before you could loop around and use a while loop to make sure that this situation can go from something that gets handled into a situation where the user can actually type it in there's no point hand on exception and realizing there's error if you don't give the user a chance to enter another value if they enter out 15 Follow by full stop when they only meant to type 15 then you need to give them another chance to type in that 15 value otherwise the program is simply just going to end and nothing's going to happen for example 15 DOT it says oh no or you can have another message that says something went wrong or you can have more specific message about the conversion and then once you press enter the program simply closes this is not an interaction that you want you want the user to be able to reselect another value so that's why it's a bad situation because you know it's been converted or not use now Bill success but the problem is we don't have any sort of looping so let's have a look so now let's comment out this and let's see how we can make our custom trip pass so we type in in. trass you can see they have a Bo inpass string s and out in result so let's try and copy that and make our own custom function so we say static Bull and then it's trass and then we have a string input and out end result perfect so now we can get rid of this line just so we use it for reference and let's use it straight in here and then we can write the implementation in a second so we can say if try pass the thing that we want to pass is actually a console read line and then we just say out into result and the console read line is going to be answered to this question which is enter a number we place it straight inside here and then we say out in result so if this has been successful we can print out yay again and else if it's not successful we can print out or not of course you can do other things inside here or you can even print out the value straight from here so we can say yay plus a space and then result just so we can get that back to the user and then oh know if something goes wrong of course this is just so we can test things and see how they work so this trass function it will take in a string input and it will try and give us back the result so in order to be able to make this successful function what we need to do is essentially do the conversion ourself which will be this convert in 32 so first we need to assign this out int so we can say result equals minus1 so now that we've used that we actually need to have return type as well but let's worry about that in a second so essentially what we actually want to do is say that the result is equal to convert to in32 and then we want to convert the input store it inside the result and if this goes successful then we want to return true and if it doesn't go successful then we want to return false but of course we need to be able to do these things separately so like we said with the try you only wrap around the section of which is going to be problematic so in this case as we've done here we've wrapped the convert in 32 inside the try so we're going to need to do that down here as well so we can open the try right here and place these two lines inside and then have a catch have a little think about what sort of catch do we need the whole point in this function is to Simply convert value and return back whether it's been successful or not there is no messages here we just need has it been successful yes or no and because we only need to know if it's a yes or a no then we can just have a generic exception and we don't need the E variable because we're not going to access the message we're going to keep it as an exception and instead of returning false down here we actually want to do this straight inside the catch so now the code reads like this we set the result to minus one and the reason why we do that is because if we don't then we're going to get a compiler error and it says that not all paths were going to assign result alternatively we can also assign result straight inside here just so we have an assignment in both paths or you could just leave it outside at the top so we assign result to minus one and then we place our problematic code straight inside here we try and convert the result and if this line returns back successful then it's going to execute the second line and return back true if this line returns back an exception it's going to miss this line completely and jump straight into the exception and then return us back with false so let's actually try this and see what happens 15 DOT or no and then 15 yay 15 so the reason why we don't care about the exception in here we can add in different values as we've used before with format exception overflow exception but as we saw with triy pass it simply just returns us back with the bull the bull simply tells us if it's been successful or not so we could stack these multiple times we can say catch and then we have the format exception and then we can place a return false in there and then we have another catch for the Overflow exception and we can place another return false in there but as you can see we're just returning false inside here so now that we've changed these it's kind of pointless each of them return back false and because we're not doing anything very specific we don't actually need to change them all together we don't care about the message we don't care the exception we only care about the fact that something has went wrong and if something has went wrong then we turn back false if everything goes okay then we return back true and that's all this Tri pass function is going to need to do it simply converts it or it doesn't convert it using an input and outputting a result so if you run it weet type in a real number we get a number back and then 15 DOT zero then we get all no because it can't come it there we go we've met all our requirements for this program let's have a look at how we can do debugging using visual studio to step through our code manually so this is the example I used last time int age equal 35 and ideally in this case you'd want something like 30 plus to be printed instead of 18 plus even though 18 plus is still technically true we'd still like 30 to be printed in this case because this says if it's over 18 do 18 if it's over 30 do 30 plus so in order to start the debugging process you shouldn't run the code first if you run the code first it's going to execute so fast that you won't get a chance to actually put any code in and try and debug it there we go we've already hit the console read line and it's executed for a split second so the best thing to do just to the left of the line numbers you want to press in the Gap and that will create a red dot and it'll tell you that this is a debugging Red Dot just in this little tool tip debugging do program. Min debuging program main so it tells us we're in the program class and we're going inside the main you can also address the debug menu up here and it says we can have a toggle break point we can add new one we can delete them all or we can actually disable deleting them will just simply get rid of them as you can see here if I set a couple more and press disable then it's going to hide them so whenever we run our code it doesn't actually apply the debugging but it doesn't delete them and then we can enable them and then we can also delete them all and it gives you a little prompt because if you do doing this inside a big project and you just spent a lot of time going through and debugging certain functions then you don't want to be able to delete them all without any confirmation so let's delete them all and put it back on line 13 which is our int Edge so let's run the code and see what happens so as you can see it minimizes our console for us and nothing's actually been printed yet because we're only up to this line and then we can use these buttons up here step into goes inside a function step over goes over the line so it will go from this line to this line step out is used after you've stepped in if you stepped into a function and then you don't want to see the rest of the function executing you can step out to jump back out of it which I'll demonstrate later on in this video so now that we've hit this line you can actually see what's going on so we have in age equals z because when this line is highlighted it means this line hasn't executed just yet so we can press this or we can press F10 on our keyboard if I press F10 you can now see in age has the value of 35 and what you can actually do is double click on it and just change the value to 30 for example now if you highlight you can see the value is 30 so you need to double click change the value to something and then simply press enter if you change the value but leave the box like this then it won't change the value so you have to remember to press enter so now I've made the age 40 but let's just change it back to 35 to keep it the same and then now what we can do we can explore what's going on here if age is greater than 18 then we're going to check if this condition is true or false so in order to check if this returns back true or false you can actually hover over the operator and it says here AG is greater than 18 is equal to true and if we hover over this one it says age is greater than 30 is equal to True notice what we actually did there we essentially ran this condition through the debugger without actually reaching this line we're only up to line 15 as of right now but we've managed to execute this and give us back a function so as you can see age greater than 30 is true and age greater than 18 is true and because this is L if chain it only cares about the first one that turns back true and because this one has turned back true then if you press F10 again you'll see that now it's went inside this curly brace which will print out the console right line if I press F10 again you can see we're now waiting on here if I use alt tab I can get back to the console you see that 18 plus has now been printed now that we're waiting here we actually press F10 one more time and then it jump straight to this read line of course because this is L if chain as soon as one of these become true and it jumps over the lse if because of course this is a chain the first one it hits that's true it skips over the rest if we didn't want this to be a chain then we could keep them as both independent if statements if age is greater than 18 and if age is greater than 30 and don't use the lse keyword but in this case because you do want to Output a different message for every single age range you do want to place the L's word in there and now that we've hit this line we can press F10 and then now we jump back in the console and now we're wear in right here and just a little tip when it comes to debugging if at any point you just want to exit the debugging you can either press continue or just press F5 and the program will run for example if we investigate this variable and we can see the value is 35 and then now we're happy with the rest of the code we can just press F5 and our code will run as normal we'll get the out print and we'll get a read line waiting here so we know our problem here is both conditions return back true so just like in the last video we actually changed this condition so to make sure that it only goes between this range but let's not repeat ourselves let's have a look at a different example so we can have string name equals Abu and then int age and then age equal 23 which I'll demonstrate why I've done it like this in a second and then let's have a function just so I can show you how to step in so we can have a static string print details string name in Edge and here actually we want to just return back a void because we just want to print out to the screen and we can say name space edge and maybe just put a dash between them and let's run that code now we can see ABA -23 of course making that function wasn't the point I actually want to show you what's going on so if we just print this a couple of times just so we can show you the step out and step in so you run the code now we can see our string name if we go over that you can see it's called abber and then now that it's stepped over this line cuz there's nothing really to execute here it's just creating back a variable so you can see that age is zero cuz that's the default value for an integ and when we skip over that now it's got the value of 23 so one line creates the integer with the default value equal to zero and then the next line will make it equal to 23 and then we're passing on the variables here and if you wanted to investigate it you could simply just hover over them like this so you can see what the values contain and then now that we've hit this function if we press F10 then it's just going to skip over it but what we actually want to do is be able to go inside the function so this is where our step in goes step over doesn't doesn't care if it's a function or a normal line it'll just step over it regardless so we want to in here we want to use step into or we can press f11 once you press for f11 you can see that now it's jumped from print details up here to print details down here and then now look if I step through it's going to actually execute these one by one so right now it hasn't executed anything so I step over this once using F10 you'll see it now appears and then the same thing with this one and this one and now that I've executed three we should see three in the console perfect so now what I want to demonstrate is let's say we're happy with the rest of this function and then now we want to just step out so I press this button and you can see it jumps back up to print details f11 to go in and then shift f11 to go out so now that we're back in here the only thing we can do really from this point is either press F5 to stop debugging or press F10 to jump to this line and at this point we've already hit the last line now code so we don't really need to use F10 anymore cuz with nothing to step over so we can just press F5 let our program finish and there we go so let's have a look at another example can have a string message equals read from console then we can pass this in enter anything and then we can have a console right line and we can just print the message and then let's create this function so because it's a return value and store inside a string we're going to need a static string read from console and then this is one string parameter so we have a string message and then we can just do a console right and then print the message to the screen and then we just want to return the console. readline there we go and again let's put a breakpoint here and we can remove this one so it doesn't always have to be the first line if we're perfectly happy with this amount of code then we can simply take that off and it will stop when it gets after this line now if you look at the console you'll see all of this is executed that function is executed four times to print the name name and age of the screen and now we're waiting here so we have our read from console and now we can step into using f11 and you can see that if you hover over string message has enter anything which is our parameter that we specified up here and then there you go and then that will print into the screen so you tap back in you'll see it says enter anything and then just at the read line we need to actually enter it now something and then press enter and then just right here it's going to return it back so if we use F10 it jumps back in here and then actually we need to execute this line so F10 again and then if you hover over a message you see it says something which is exactly what we typed in the console here and then we just print it back to the screen there you go and now we just at the console read line and we can press F5 to finish up there we go so debugging is mainly used by pressing this button on the side so debugging is used by pressing on the empty Gap just to the left of the line number and it will create a red dot once you create a red dot it'll highlight this for you once you've clicked done it it should show up a red dot you can also disable or delete all the break points from the debug window at the top of the screen when you run the code it will stop here and then you can either use F9 as a shortcut as well click into the line that you want to debug and press F9 please note there is specific cases where if you try and press this one right here it's not going to let you if the line doesn't really do anything for example this is creating an integer there's no real action that's happening here that you should or want to debug this is an assignment this is an assignment this is a function call and so on and so forth and this is also a function call when it comes to just declaring variables then a compiler does not let you put in a breakpoint because there's nothing really to investigate when you're just creating a variable so don't get thrown off or think something's wrong if you click on the empty line and nothing appears so that's it for debugging but let's just have a little recap we can use F10 to step over f11 to step into functions shift f11 to step out or you can use the buttons that appear at the top of the screen when you run the code just right here hover over variables and you get their values as I showed you in the if statements if you hover over the operator inside the if statement it will actually tell you what the condition is and whether it's true or false so me say if1 equals equals to 1 and let's just print out true to the screen just so I can demonstrate this if a hover r that equals equals it says 1 equals equals 1 is true so that's how you check if a condition is going to be true or false when you're debugging you can check the parameter values by simply hovering over it and the tool tip should include the value just like so and if you wanted to step into this function you can use step into and then use step over which is F10 just here and then you can actually investigate these values as well or you can look at the parameters and once you're done with the function you can do shift f11 or you can use step out and then you can skip over this and the same thing with this you can have a look at the string variable once it gets returned something in here and now it says something in here and string message and then we can print out to the screen Etc so you can have a little bit of Freedom with what you can do in terms of debugging play around to debuging in the past exercises that we've made together and then what you can actually do is gain experience in debugging so it comes to more complicated projects you can also apply that learning there and make sure that your code is error free so we covered how to debug by pressing the white space just to the left of the line number if we run the code the program will stop where our breakpoint is and it won't execute the line that we're up to we have to step over it so we've actually use this before to analyze our functions and see what values are inside things so we have these extra windows called the local and the auto so let's take a look at them and see what they're about so again if you don't have this layout you can use window reset layout and it should be in the left panel not the right one this time so we've got watch which we'll explore later and we're going to have locals and Autos so the autos because we're up to the age then it shows us the age has value zero and then that prevents us from hovering over it and if we step over it you'll see that now it's got age 23 and now name has appeared the auto tab will try and figure out what functions and what parameters you need to be displayed down here based on the section of cord that you up to so my guess is because we're up to this function and it takes in a name and age then we're getting name and age appearing before when we were on this line it was only showing back the age and because that section only used the age we only got age here but if you press locals you can see all the variables that are local to this main function are actually showing up we have a parameter called ARs and technically this is a parameter and it's a string a ray type but it's currently unused but it's still a parameter so you can see it down here and then in order we have have the name variable down here then we've got the age and then we've got the message which is currently said to know because we haven't created this in memory yet but as you can see this changes depending on the scope of our variables so now that we're about to hit this function let's use the step into and you'll see that the locals have now changed we've got rid of name age argument and string message and it's replaced with name and age because remember what I saying about the scope of the variables parameters inside a function are always going to be local to that function around the curly braces that they're surrounded by name and age is only within here so when it's trying to shows the local variables it's only local to what's inside these curly braces which in this case is name and ede so now if we step over this and then if we step into this read from console you'll see that just before we step into this function that these have all came back cuz again the scope has changed back to this function which is our main function which has all these variables inside so our read from console will only have our Str message so hopefully when we press f11 or press the step into button at the top we should only see the message variable inside here there we go we get enter anything cuz that's what was passed in over here and then as soon as we return back to that let we type something in and then we get all of the values again and you can see that system. console. reine had returned hello which is this line and then if we press F10 again you'll see that even though we've got it back here our message is about to be assigned once we step over this there you go it says hello and as you can see this changes in real time so as soon as we step over lines hello got placed straight into there this helps us tremendously because we don't have to keep hovering over variables like this to keep checking over their values you can simply use this menu and it will always update because whenever you change Scopes between functions that will automatically update as you just saw in them examples there we go and then when the program ends obviously this window is going to close down so that's a very help helpful method have being able to debug without having to hover over anything in the next video we're going to cover how to watch variables and this can be very handy when you're looking for specific errors another really good debuging technique is the watch window let's press a break point just of left of line 13 and let's run the code and let's see what this is about so we covered that we have the locals window and we have the auto window that will automatically give us the variabl that we're currently in the scope of but let's forget about that right now let's have a look at the watch window it says here add an item to watch so there's a couple ways that we can do this you can actually double click on a variable and right click or you can just highlight it like this and then right click and it says here add watch and you can press it it says name value null because we haven't created it yet so the default value is null as of right now cuz it's not actually assigned anything so you press F10 and step over it you'll see that immediately changes to abber without was having to do anything except simply press F10 which is the shortcut for our step over button right at the top of the screen this prevents us from having to hold over the variables to get the little tool tip so we can see the value the power of this is we can watch variables and we don't have to worry about showing in the locals or the auto because it's always there and if you have lots of variables like this then you're only concerned about the one that you're watching locals and aluto will always change depending on the scope that you currently at whereas watch will only do what you want it to do so because we don't put age inside there then it's simply won't come up just because it likes it if we check the locals we have agent there and the Autos we have agent there as well but we don't have it in the watch so what else you could do is actually just type straight into here age 23 if you really wanted to you can actually also type in conditions age equals equals 23 it returns back true so if you had an if statement that you wanted to track then you could do that as well so let's have a look so it a statement that said if age is greater than than 18 then we can just print out 18 plus to the screen so let's run the code now and see what happens so as you know we have this condition right here so if you actually highlight this and drag and drop it you can see that the cursor changes and you can drop it inside here let's click on the AG equals equal 23 and click delete so of course we can't really render this function right now because we haven't even created the integer variable so let's run over the integer variable and as you can see here it says AG is zero which is the default value for integer and that is is indeed zero right now and then age is greater than 18 is false but as soon as I step over this line and it makes age the value of 23 you'll see that these two immediately change you know they change because the values have went red red means that the values have just changed in the last button that you pressed whether that means he stepped into over or stepped out it doesn't matter red always dictates that the value is just changed so now it's telling us that age is greater than 18 is returned back true so when I step over this line because this is returned back true I should render 18 plus let's have a look F10 F10 and there we go we've reached the middle which means that's going to get printed out now so moving on to another example we can have print details if we go into this function and let's say we only concerned about the name then we can print out the name down here but as you can see we already have it twice so that's just going to update depending on the parameter name and even if you wanted to show something like this you can drag this down here and it actually shows you the output this is very handy so you can see the output because sometimes when you have it like this it doesn't look very clear you can also hover over it right there and you can see the value placed here but again it's very handy to have it here so you don't have to keep hovering over the tool tape just to see the values and from here you can actually change the values so we can just say Harry is now the value for the name and Harry is going to be age 35 so when we press F5 and let the program run naturally you'll see that Harry is age 35 now and that's all done through the watch list down here here and it doesn't even matter because we have full control over the watch list variables and we can change their contents to see how our code acts in different situations so please use this watch list as much as you can and don't forget that once you can double click on variables and add it to the watch just from here you can also say quick watch and what that'll let you do is it'll give you the value and then if you want to add it you can press add watch here or you can just keep pressing re-evaluate once you've skipped over some lines so let's say we skipped over it now and then go back onto it and because it has a shortcut shift F9 we can just quickly press it like this and it says abber inside here and we can change the expression maybe do something like age and then click re evalue it and it changes the value to zero and then we can even change this to like 50 for example as you can see down here it's changed to 50 as well so you can drag and drop it into here or you can double click and press add watch it's up to you please make use of this watch variable and don't rely too much on the autos and the local just so you can keep your own variables inside here and you can have complicated outputs like these you can check conditions you can check console outputs as well as just checking normal variables so using the watch window you have lots of different opportunities to keep track of your code so we've got another debugging task let's try and run the code and see what happens we're going to get printed over 18 so our value is AG equals 35 and we're already getting over 18 printed to the screen so if we place a Brak line inside here and actually run the code we can see what's going on we can add them inside the watch just like this we can add in all the conditions inside just like this perfect so we can actually see here that because our age is over 35 it's saying greater than 18 is true greater than 30 is true but greater than 50 isn't true and we can easily see that except because this is an if and an else if chain as soon as the first one is true it's going to enter that one you press press F10 then we get over 18 and then as soon as it finishes that path it actually skips all the way to the end the problem with this is we only want it to print over 30 since it's over 30 so we have to introduce ranges inside here and we can say age is less than 30 and then you can have ages greater than 30 here and then you can also insert an end and say AG is less than 50 and there we go and now it says over 30 and if we change this to 55 then we should get over 50 and then finally if we change this to something like 23 then we should also get over 18 perfect so what was going on here is because we had if and else if chains then you're only going to get one of them printed and because a value over 18 satisfied both the first path and the second path then it's only going to print the first path if we actually undo our changes all the way till the start and then we actually flip the order of this if we put our this one first and delete the El's and change it to lse if inside here so now we have a new chain except the first one in the chain is actually if age is greater than 30 now if you're on the code you'll see that the first one actually says over 30 and it says over 30 and it doesn't say over 18 anymore but simply because this is the first one in the list as soon as it hits the first one as I'll demonstrate now it will go inside this bracket hit this curly brace and then jump straight to the end you should always order them from smallest to biggest because that will probably make the most logical sense when you're reviewing your code and in doing so you can actually have a more formatted code but you need to watch out that the ranges need to make sense if you have something like this then you need to restrict this one because it's going to be blocking the second one and you don't want to make these all ifs because then you get multiple outputs now we should get 18 and 30 being printed to the screen this is not something you want so make sure that you place your ranges inside here by adding an and and then placing the other end of it which will be 30 and then this one will continue from it so so just to sum up what you need to do is make sure that you use Els and make sure that you have ranges just so when one exits it's going to check the other one and the other one you don't want the first condition to beat the second one if that's for the right path age 35 goes into this path or at least we want it to but it's been restricted by the fact that age is greater than 18 when we had it like this this is restricting everything over 18 to go inside this path if this was even like 65 we should only fall into this one and we run the code then we're still going to get over 18 which is still technically true it is still over 18 but we have different outputs for this sort of age range make sure that you use lfs and you keep in an appropriate range and keep them in the order of the if statements going from lowest to highest or whatever makes sense in that situation that you're using it this is a start of objectoriented programming let's start with a concept called structures structures allow us to store different data types inside one data type so it's almost like a group of data types we can demonstrate this if you wanted to stall something like a person you would normally have something like a string name equals ABA and in age equal 23 so in here we have a string name that represents the name and in age which represents their age and you can see that because these are two different data types you can't wrap them around inside an array you can't have a string array called person and then say we want to have two different values although this will still compile we can't store both these data types inside array unless you make the ede and store it as a string which will be 23 inside the quotation marks and then you'll have to worry about converting it later on in your program so this is not really ideal so we have something called a structure so just outside here we can say struct which stands for structure and then we can have our name straight after so we can say person in the next time we just open the curly braces and let's see what we've just created so now in order to make an instance of this we can actually use that like a data type between say person person there we go so now we've created our person variable now you see we've got our own data type before we're just using string and ins and arrays and things like that but now we actually have a new person so because our person is made up of a name and an age let's place that in here string name and then inage of course you don't want to give them default values because like all variables you don't know what the value is going to be to begin with so now what we can do person Dot and we don't actually have access to using these values yet so what we're going to have to do there is a concept called access modifiers which we'll cover on later on in this course but just for now what this means is you either have private or public and they're the main two words there's other words that you can have but they're the main two for now if you have it private it means you can't access it down here through person. name and but as soon as you make this public then now it becomes accessible there we go we can make that equal to something and if we take off public then you see we don't have access to it it's inaccessible due to its protection level because the protection level is private which means that you can only access name Within These two curly braces the second you make it public it means that anyone outside of the structure EG down here can also have access to name so if we do that to our public on int age and string name then we actually can access both now we can say person. Ag and it comes up like this the purple cube is a function and the blue is Fields you you can actually filter them out by pressing them down here show only methods and show only Fields so we can do age equals 23 and I can actually just place abber inside here now that this data is essentially the same as this the benefit that we have now is when we print to the screen we can say person. name and then hyphen person. Ag and if you run that now you we Abid 23 if we actually copy and paste this lined out and just remove person dot just so we're using these two variables at the top of here and we in the code you should see exactly the same values coming up there we go but now what's really handy about this situation is we have two data types that are wrapped inside of one data type instead of having a name and age we have a person because what gets really easy now is if you wanted to add something else inside here like for example birth month which for me is five so in here you'd have to make another one birth month equals 5 and then all we have to do inside our person is just say person. birthmonth and we could just assign it right here instead of having to create a whole new variable we add it up here and then we can use it down here and then we can add that into here person. birthmonth and we can add this to this one and then get rid of birth month and as you can see it's exactly the same so we've taken these data types and placed it inside our structure so then we can just reference it by the person this becomes very very handy for this exact reason that I'm going to show show you now let's say you wanted to read this data R from the user so you have static and then you're a bit stuck on what data type you want to return if you forget about the birth month then we have a name and age as a very basic person but our return type only lets us have one type so that's going to be a problem now so you could do a string return that will give us back the name and then we can say return person and inside the brackets what you can actually do is do out in Edge so you can have two output variables an out Edge and then a return string since hiide here we could say enter your name and then string name equals console do read line if we copy and paste this down and then we can say enter your age and then we can say int age equals convert to and 32 and then put the console read line inside there there we go now that we've got that we don't actually need inage because we've already got output parameter so we just need to be Edge and then after we've retrieved them two values we can return name there we go so let's actually try that up here so we can say new name is equal to return person and then out in new ede and you can take this exact line paste it down here get rid of the birth month and then we can use new age in here and new name inside here so let's run that now ask us what is your name ABA what is your age 23 and then we got ABA 23 which is the same as what we've got before but you see that this situation is prettyy messy we have to return a string variable and also use an output in order to be able to give back two values alternatively what we could do is actually just return back void and then we can say string name and then inage but we're going to have to use references inside here and then have string new name equals nothing and then new inage equals 0o so we have string new name equals nothing and then into New Age also equal to nothing and then inside our function instead of having out parameters we can actually use a reference and we can say a new name and then ref New Age and what that will do is we can just return it like this because it's void instead of declaring a new string name we can actually just assign it to the reference that just passed and because it's a void parameter now and for the return type we don't actually need to return anything so we can actually assign these by reference enter your name ABA and 23 so as you can see it still works fine but let's say we wanted to add another birth month so we' have to take the birth month variable new birth month make it equal to zero and then add yet another parameter ref new birth month and then we need a new birth month inside here ref int birth month and then we need another one from here enter your birth month and then we'd start it inside birth month and then finally we can also return it up here as new birth month there we go AB 23 and then five so we get them values being returned so in order to keep adding different properties to your code you have to make a new parameter a new reference variable and then append the parameters inside the function now the problem that is even though you can have an infinite amount of parameters then this gets very tedious very quickly and you don't want this so let's have a look at how we can make this function exactly the same way just using our new structure you can see that instead of having to pass all of these different things in or return back a certain value we can actually just return back a complete person so all of this can be squished pretty quietly so actually let's just comment all of this out and let's comment out this function and let's have another rewrite so now that everything's gone we only want to be returning and dealing with the person so we can say static and instead of void we actually want to say we want to give the user back a person return person and we don't need any parameters in in this case this is only passed in because it's a reference so we can assign these values back to the original variables but because we're going to be returning a person then we don't need to do that so we can essentially take this code and put it in here and we can say string name now we have an in here and then also an in here there we go so now that we've constructed all our variables that we need for the person what we can do is we can make a new person person person and then person. name equals name and then duplicate this down we say a person. ag is equal to age and finally the birth month is equal to the birth month and then now that we've constructed our person we still got a red underline because we haven't returned anything yet and after all of that we can say return person there we go and now simply in here we could just say person person equals return person there we go and then we can take this console right line here and place it straight underneath since it uses the same properties now let's try and run it AB 235 there you go so now instead of having to make a whole new variable all you have to do is simply just add another one down here so we can just say number this could be your favorite number or anything and we can add it onto here person. number and then here we can paste this down we can say enter your number and then it will be number in here we can paste it down here and change it to number and there we go that's all we need to change and this code doesn't change cuz it's simply calling back the function and we're doing all the hard work inside here so now if you run this enter your name abber 23 5 and finally four and there you go we get the values being returned so this looks a little bit tedious we have to assign each one individually every single time we do it so we can actually use something called a Constructor in order to achieve this result we make the person we set them and then we return it it' be easier if we could have the Constructor that we can assign straight inside here and then just return it immediately instead of having to do all of these lines and then reference each one individually so let's have a look and see what we can do inside here we can have a new function that'll just be called whatever the structure is called then you open the brackets close the brackets for now and this is called a Constructor in order to be able to use it down here we need to make it public in order for someone else to access it so this says that it needs explicit parameters in order to be able to compile it says that it needs to assign name age birth month and number so let's see how we can do that as we've used Constructors in the past for example when we had things like the string Builder we had s SP equals new string Builder and when you make a new something that means you're making a new Constructor so all of these sixes are the parameters that go inside of this but each one of these is a separate Constructor if we control click this we should be able to see them all there we go you see that the class is called string Builder and this is called string Builder and these two names match exactly so to make a string Builder you can give it any one of these as long as your parameters match one of these six you can give it nothing or you can give it some other values and that's the same is true with our current person so what we need to do in this case is we don't have multiple ways that we can constru this in the case of our person we have to provide all of these details otherwise the compiler is not going to like it so we can have a string name int age int birth month and int number now we got our parameters set up we actually need to make use of them in here so because we have name and name and they're exactly the same string by string then in here we can't say name equals name in terms of global and local variables this is global within the structure as it's within these two curly braces and all of these variables are only Within These two curly braces local variables always take presidence over the main one if I double click on this you'll see that all three are referencing this Constructor if I double click on this you'll see that both name references on line 20 down here is all referencing this one in the parameter and not the one up top we want it to be assigned into here so you have two options in this case you could capitalize all of these so then you don't run into this issue and then instead of name equals name it's capital N equals name and that fixes it alternatively if you want it to be a lower case then what you can simply do is you can place this dot if you use this it goes back to the current scope and the current scope of name is going to be this which is within the structure when you use this it doesn't reference the local variables it references the global variables appear so when I double click on this now you'll see that that gets highlighted so we can say this. ede equals ede this. birth month equals birth month and finally this. number equals number so we're just getting all the parameters from here and putting them into these values this might look a little bit redundant but I'll show you why this is a lot cleaner so back in our return person function we have the variable and then we assign them all manually but look how easy this now has became if I comment out this return we can say a return person so now we can reference person with a capital P this time cuz I want to reference the structure directly so after the person we can open the brackets and then start to type in so our first one is name age and the birth month name comma age comma birth month comma and then number comma and then this is not going to like it because we also need to place new inside as I said before when you making a string Builder you have a new keyword and this new means that you want to create a new instance of this you could think of this structure as a template this is the template for something and until you start using that something it's actually not going to do anything so we have to make a new instance of it because it's not already available so we need to make it available through our data type so when we say we want a new person that gives us access to the Constructor if I remove that you'll see we've got one of two now we can create an empty person and that will just make us assign all the values individually but we don't want that we want to use the second path and if you drop the arrow you'll be able to see the different parameters which is the ones we just typed in name age birth month and then number and now that we've returned back this we actually don't even need to do any of these lines right here we can actually just return it exactly like this so now if you run it again you should see exactly the same output 23 5 and four perfect so let's just have a little recap so normally when we're creating variables we use common variables that we've used in the past string in double Flo bull Etc but with the use of structures we can create our own group of variables and then we can use them VAR Ables inside functions and inside our code to make things a lot cleaner and a lot easier so inside person we actually stall four different variables and they can be an infinite amount of variables should you will and you can easily remove them and then remove them from the parameters and from the assignment and then that's it if we use this without our structure then we're going to have to declare every single variable separately and I know this is the same as doing it up here it's actually a little bit more work cuz you need to create a new parameter and create all the the instances inside here and assign the values now the benefit of doing it within a structure is that when you go to do a function look how easy this line is before you'd have to have name age birth month all as references or have them as out parameters and it gets a little bit long and a bit sloppy you only to include the month in here we' have to have another int number and you can see that the parameters are growing if you wanted to store a user from a registration form you might have name address phone number country and the list goes on it can be a very long form and you therefore you'll have a lot of parameters so it's very easy to wrap it around inside a structure and then simply reference it like that and you'll need zero parameters because everything is contained within the data type and then inside here we can ask for the users's details individually store them as their integers and string variables and then instead of using this notation we can now use our fancy Constructor where we can pass it in in this exact order right here name age birth month and then the number perfect and then we can use inside here we can call each of these positions separately and concatenate them together so now that we covered structures known by struct as the keyword let's have a look at classes and how to define them syntactically so we can make a struct called person and we can give them a string name and inage and to make them accessible we'll make them public and we can say public person string name and int age and that means we can assign these values using the Constructor so we can say this.name equals equal name and this. age equals age perfect so let's get rid of our compiler error since we're assigning both the values and then down here we can use it we can say person person equals new person and then have abber and then 23 in the brackets and we can print to the screen person. name and then if use controll D to duplicate that down and we can do age and if we run that right now we should see abber and 23 being printed to the console perfect so as we talked about introduction syntactically the struct and the classes are very similar so let's comment this out so we don't get any compile errors and let's see how this is going to work so of course we're going to get error on this line but once we make our class the error should disappear from here so instead of struct person we're simply just going to have class person exactly the same and because these are fields we can also copy these down so we can have public string name and public int age and then we can have public person and then string name in age this do name equals name and this. age equals age so as you can see this is exactly the same as this except for the fact we have structure and we have class inside here now you see how compile error is gone and if you've run the code we should see exactly the same output there we go now the main difference about classes and about structures is that you don't actually have to give these a default value inside the Constructor if we just comment this one out for a second and if we bring the structure back and we actually remove the parameters from here then we're actually going to get compile errors and it says that the name and age must be assigned before it's returned and stroks cannot have parameterless Constructors now that's a bit of a problem in certain cases you might want to create an instance of something but not actually derive any values so you could actually make these into default values you can have string name equals nothing and int age equals zero and therefore once we place in inside here then there's no problems if you run the code then you will get the output this will be nothing this will be zero and you'll get errors and you won't get any compile errors doing this way but the point is you have to include them and you don't have a choice so if you just comment this back out now what you'll notice about the class person is even if we get rid of it then it still lets us have it of course we can't actually give it parameters since we don't have a Constructor that lets us have parameters but what you can do as well is you can overload this and actually include it as well so you can have another set that literally lets you define both of them and then you can even have another overload that lets you just include the name without the edge and then also another one that lets you include the int Edge without the name or you include both the details so in these cases what you can do is you can store the values up here as the fields let them use a default Constructor or only give it the name or the age or you can actually give it both so when we come down into here we actually now have four different Constructors we can make an empty person we can make it with an edge with the name or with both and what you can do in here is you can say this.name is equal to nothing and then here you can say this. AG is equal to minus one just to default it to a value that's incorrect so after we've got this let's have a look at the different ways so we can give it a person which gives us an empty value so if you run that now we get blank and zero and if we just give it the name which is Aba then we should get ABA in minus one yep and then if we just give it the age you should get nothing in 23 and if you actually give them both then you should get both printed out to the screen and there we go so now we have four different ways that we can create our person with our structure we're only really limited to one since all of these values need to be assigned as the structure is created structures are meant to be used as an extension to a data type rather than almost like a mini management system when we make a class we have so many options of different ways that we can do this inside here and later on in the course we're going to show you how to include functions inside here and then eventually do other Advanced Techniques with classes that aren't directly available structures if you have a basic example where you want to extend something to use inside a function or a data type like starring name and age instead of having to do two return types inside a function then a struct is perfect the second you want to do more complicated things or make it a bit more specific and flexible then classes are the way forward you'll see it very often in games where they have struct position you'll see in video games where they have something like a struct position and they might have int X int Y and int Zed and that's for their 3D position or they might even just have an X and Y or you could have something simple like a rectangle and you can give it a width and a length so now when you use that inside the code you're going to have different flexibilities of the amount with data types that you can store and then when you return that back from a function that will be okay as well since you can use this as a data type so if you want something simple and straightforward then go for the struct the second you want something a bit more complicated and a bit flexible then you probably want a class we go into more different situations inside this cause so you understand in which cases to use what and in most cases you'll notice that the class is more replicable so if you wanted to you could ask the user to enter these details in and then you can pass them inside the Constructor so we could say a console right line changes to a right enter your name String name console. readline and then copy and paste this down change this into a int age and then wrap this around inside a convert in32 instead of enter your name it'll be n your H and then since these are grayed out it means we haven't used them so we can change abber to your name and then change 23 to H perfect so now if you run the code now enter your name ABA enter your age 23 then we get AB number 23 printed out to the screen so just a quick recap Constructors are basically defined the same way you have public followed by the class or the structure name and then the parameters inside the brackets and then you can assign it after without structure you have to declare all of the variables inside the parameter and assign them all down here otherwise you won't be able to run your code with classes we have the flexibility of just including one default function which will just be our Constructor and even if it does nothing this is still acceptable and then we broke it down to multiple sections where you might have situations where you only want their name or their age or you might even collect both to store it if you collect the name then we'll initialize age to minus one just so you know that this is a bad value and if you declare only the age then we'll initialize a to nothing just so you know that it's an empty value and if you accept both then we simply assign both and down here we have access to it we can even make this a little bit better by checking these values so we can say if string is not null or mty of person. name and we can put a not inside here then we can print out this and then the same thing for age we can say if person. AG we can say greater than minus one since we set minus one as the bad value and then we can move this line up and let's try run it now so these two if statements are fundamentally separate from each other one is checking the name and one is checking the age so let's try and manually type these in and see what happens so enter your name let's make this blank and only include the age and let's see if this runs okay so you had no name in the age of 23 then you see we only get printed 23 because it'll skip over this line as you can see if we put a break point in now and just refresh the code we get empty name plus 23 and when we press F10 over this line it jumps the next one because if we hover over this you'll see that it should return us back with false there we go we get strings null or empty is is false so that'll skip over that and because the age is 23 then this line is going to execute let's run it again and do the opposite we could say name is Aba and then age is minus one and then we get ABA printed be not the age there we go so if you wanted to fix these in and type them manually so we can say 23 there we go we get 23 and if we only include the name ABA then we only get ABA printed out and if we include both both of them then we get them both printed out perfect so now that we've created our class we've gave it some fields and we've made our Constructor that lets us initialize it let's see how we can print the details out to the console so we can have a CW tab tab a console right line and then we can say string interpolation name callon space and then we can have our curly braces and we can say person. name we can access these fields using the dot operator and then we can say back/ again for the new line and then say age and the same thing person. AG let's try run that and see what we've got so now we've outputed name and age out to the screen let's see how we can do this inside a function if you wanted to place this in different part of your code then you're going to have to copy and paste this and as we know this is bad for our code because it's j a duplication we want to be able to wrap this inside a function somewhere so let's see what we can do we can have a static string so you can return us back with this that we can output straight to the console and we can say return details and for our parameter we can have something like string name and int age because that's what our class is made up of and inside here we can simply take this put it inside here and put a return before it and then get rid of the person dot since we have an aim and age variables as local to the function so now instead of this line we can duplicate this down take out the contents and we can say return details and then we can place person. name and person. AG inside here let's r on the code so we get exactly the same output but the problem with this function is we're having to type out the parameters manually we have them here and we're going to have to type them again in here and again for the parameters this is a bit of a problem because we've just made our class but we haven't really used it when we're passing it in so instead of having string name and int age we can actually duplicate this method and just comment it out just so you can see it for reference and instead of doing this you can actually just pass in an entire person so now we have access to person and we can bring this back and we can say person. name and we can also say person. Ag and the reason why this method is preferred is if you actually have something else public int number and then you added another one inside here int number and then you said this do number equals number the parameters won't have to change inside the function all you have to do is simply pass in the person and then now we actually have access to doing person. number inside here should we need to if you passing them all all in one by one like this then you have to append into number on the end and then add it straight to here and then also add it inside here as you have like this it's easy to pass the class in because all of these properties above are just simply used throughout the function so now if we just bring this back and let's have a run and see if we get the same output which we do name ABA age 23 perfect so now that we've thought of two functions how to do this we we can manually type in the strings and the integer and any other parameters that we need or we can actually pass in the person the problem with these two approaches is the whole point of having classes and structures of the like is so we can wrap around lots of functionality inside it if you want to send this to another developer for them to use in their project or maybe this is a file that is shared within the projects then you don't want them to include a separate function that is simply outside of the class we want to include the functions inside the class so of course as you know these are functions so inside side here we can also make functions so let's do it so we can have public and we want a string return details and then we don't need to pass anything in the the values that we're going to be returning are these two right here which is technically local to our class so therefore we're not going to have any parameters I'll explain that further in a second so we can take this exact line paste it straight into here and get rid of the person Dot and get rid of the person dot on this side so then we have the name variable and the age variable if you double click on them you see it references these variables and the same thing for age the reason why we don't have parameters is when you call this function as I'll show you in a second you call it directly on the person so the person that you're trying to print has already got these contents inside of them so let's have a look we can duplicate this down and instead of calling return details and passing the person you actually do it the other way around you say the person object dot return details so now we're calling return details inside our person person an object now let's run the code you see the output is exactly the same except now this functionality is a lot better our return details is wrapped inside our class which is the preferred way now we can actually get rid of these inside here and then we shouldn't really use this notation even though is technically correct but you want to wrap all your functionality inside here and just bear in mind that scope is also applicable here return details is within this class which means if you try to run this function inside the main then it's not going to node exist this return details function was able to be used inside here because this was in the scope of the class program which is this curly brace and this curly brace but this return details is only within the scope of this class which means you can't just suddenly use it inside the main so please bear that in mind when you producing these classes and you're trying to understand where everything goes every function that you place inside here is accessible through the dot notation after the object once you've created the class soose person equals new person and then after we type person dot then we'll get a list of all the functions the same way if you have something else just like this and then if you do person Dot and then you see that something has appeared there so all the functions that you create up inside in this class for every person that you make it'll be accessible through the dot notation so just to round up this video you should always make your functions inside your class having them inside the class is the whole point of making a big class and have lots of functionality side if you keep the function that does exactly the same thing outside of the class then if you were to share this file or come back to it in the future then you're not going to understand why you've done this and it's outside the class keeping everything wrapped inside the class is the best way forward in most case scenarios so now we have our class person it's got a name and age a Constructor and a function to return back the details and we can simply use it like this and return back the details like this but so far we've covered how to make classes Constructors Etc and assign the values but the values are only getting assigned throughout the Constructor but what if a different part of our program the user want to change their name update their age Etc then what options do we have so you know we can access our Fields using person. name and then you can simply type equals and then type in another name and we can say person. AG equals 25 now we've changed these properties if we use the console right line and return details you'll see that the values have indeed changed as you can see there it's changed the Harry in 25 this is okay except for the fact that this shouldn't really be possible we should try and restrict this directly by the use of gets and sets so for now we're going to cover fields and how to restrict certain values and later on in the course we're going to go through what properties are so before alter properties got invented we had to use gets and Setters gets and sets are essentially functions that will prevent this from happening so the reason why we can do this is simply because this public word is placed right here if we change it to private it means that name is still accessible within here and here which is only the limit of the class but as you can see it's not applicable here this is why you need the public Getters and Setters so I'll explain that what that means now so we prevent these from accessing outside the class by making them private so this functionality no longer works so what you have to do instead is for every field that you have you need to create a getto and a set a function so in order to set a value we can have public and because we're setting it we don't need to return anything so it'll be void and we can say set name and then we pass in string name and then we simply just say this. name equals name so when someone calls set name and pass in the name like this we just overwrite it so let's see how that looks so if we comment these two lines out we can simply say person do set name and then we can say Harry so this line is directly replaced by this line and now if you run this we'll see that Harry should be changed there you go abber is changed to Harry this is really powerful because what we can do now is restrict the access inside here and make sure that the value contain something genuine we can say if string is null or empty and then pass the name inside there if the string isn't null or empty then we assign it and if it is null or empty then what we can do inside here is we can say else this do name equals nothing and we can keep it blank or we can use string. empty just to make sure that we know that the name has been blanked out if they've entered something invalid if they've entered something that's valid we assign it if it's invalid then we don't assign it and we just initialize it back to nothing and because our options are endless with this we can actually make this into something else we can simply just say invalid name so then what happens is if we try and change this to nothing and we run the code we can see that we get invalid name being printed to the screen and that's a lot better than if we had string.empty because if you had strings are empty then it would kind of say nothing then it looks like something's went wrong if you have something like invalid then that gives you a bit of a bar message so we can have invalid name there so using our Setter Let's us change our name from down here without directly exposing the public if he expose the public then everyone who uses classes can simply change the name to whatever they want having it private and only changing the name within the set name function is very preferable because you can restrict the access and what people can set the values to if they try to set it to something that's not valid then we set it to invalid name whereas before when we did this and if we make this public again we can simply set this to something bad like null null is a very bad value but it still lets us have it and the reason why it's very bad is if you you try to do something like this person do equals and just some empty brackets now even if I just leave this empty the fact that you try call equals onside person. name is going to be a bit of a problem so we can say person object the name property inside it and we're checking if it equals to abber for example but because we've just set it to null let's see what happens you see that we actually get an exception it's a null reference exception because if you hover over name you see that returns back null nulls are very bad in this case whereas if we actually bring our function back and we make this into a private and then if we try and take this value our null value and place it straight inside our set name if you uncomment it get rid of the quotation marks and if you actually try and assign it to null let's see what happens then we're going to get invalid name and this prevents us from breaking our code if a function like equals were to be called on any of our properties inside of name so now that we've done it for our name we can also do it for our age but before we do that we can also call a function called get name return details gives you back these details in a very specific fashion but what if you wanted to do something like this your name is and then you wanted to do person. name but of course you can't do that because name is no longer public so you can't reference it directly so we've got a set name and then now we need to do a get name so we can have public and because name is a string the return type is going to be string and we can say get name and this function is very simple it just returns back name and that's it there's no parameters because all it does is return back a value and in this case it's just returning back name so instead of using person. name in here we can say person. getet name open close the brackets to indicate it's a function but there's no parameters now you see that we have no compile errors so now if you run that you'll see that it says your name is invalid name so let's actually give it a value and we can say hurry again run the code there you go your name is hurry so let officially change it and now let's work on the edge so just following the exact same approach we can have a public void set age int age and instead of just doing this. age equals age let's try set some boundaries on this we can wrap this inside an if statement so as for the condition we want to valid Val if the age is successful so we want to do if age is greater than or equal to zero and age is less than or equal to 150 so this means if the age is less than zero or greater than 150 then this is going to return back false and then it's not going to assign the value and we can simply assign it to minus one minus one is just so we know it's a bad value so now that we've created our set age we can actually make our get age so we want to return back an INT because that's going to be the data type PR age so we do public int get age we don't need any parameters cuz as like the name we're just simply returning something so we can say return age so now that you've made the set age and the get age let's actually use it in our code so we've made our set name and let's say person do set age and we have 25 inside here just like above and then now that we've set the age let's appin this sentence we can say and your age is and then person. getage perfect so let's run the code and see what happens there we go we have 25 and Harry being changed so another little tip when we doing this code our get age is one line and I'll set age as a couple of lines but fundamentally only assigning age so what we can do is we can make these into the tertiary operator so as we can see here this is the condition if this returns back true then we assign age our local parameter and if this returns back false we assign minus one so we can actually make this into this. AG equals if you remember remember the format of our conditional operator use condition true and then condition false so this is our condition that is leading our if statement and if this returns back true then we do question mark and put age in there and then call on if it returns back false then it's simply minus one there we go so this has actually been entirely replaced by this one simple line and we can do the same thing for our string so we can say this.name is equal to string that is null or empty pass the name name inside there and if that is true then we assign it to name and if that is false we say invalid name let's comment this one out and let's see if all code runs okay still hurry 25 hurry 25 and now let's try our bad values so we can try to set the age to 200 and the value to nothing and let's see what happens we get invalid name minus one and there you go perfect so that's working okay let's undo them values and you can see that this has been shorten completely another top tip for functions like this you can actually use something called Arrow functions and if you've done any JavaScript this might be quite familiar so we can have our get ede and instead of open the curly braces at this point we can actually place this Arrow inside so if we comment out this one with arrow functions you can only return back one simple line so because this is only one line we can have return age but our functions don't like the keyword return any variable that you put straight inside here is automatically applied that it's a return type so we literally just put age get age returns us back with age if this is confusing then stick to this approach but this can might tidy up your code because instead of having all of this and all the curly braces for one simple line you can use Arrow function so if you actually copy and paste but first comment out all of these functions you can see how small the code can actually get there we go and then let's actually have a public void set age let's put our R function in and then we can take this one line and paste it straight into here so you can see that these two lines are now being replaced by all of this and of course we need our int age inside here there we go so now we can do the same thing with our set name we can take this we can have public vo set name String name and then have our Arrow function and then simply paste that in you can see that this will get a little bit long now but it's still ideal I've got the code zoomed in but if you put that to 100% you'll see that this code is actually pretty small it's just I've zoomed in just so you can see the code a lot clearer and then finally for public string and we can get name and then we simply just do arrow and then name and you can see that with all this other code commented we just relying on these functions as we just created and you'll see there's no console errors or anything else so if you try and run it you'll see that everything is going okay of course if you don't like this notation and you don't have to include it you can stick with the curly braces I don't use Arrow functions a lot in practice because there isn't many situations where you'd actually use them and even if you do some people might not like them or there might be certain guidelines that you might be following inside a company what I do suggest you stick with is the tertiary operator these are a lot good and a lot better to use since it reduces the cord drastically if we actually remove this and I'll paste it back in just so you can see it for reference inside the resources but you can see that these four functions are now reduced to on one page you can see that they're all got one lines and they're pretty short so let me undo that just so you can see the original code and have it for reference so there's a lot covered inside this video so let's just have a little recap before we finish up so just to start at the beginning when we initialize our person with their name and their age we don't actually have any other opportunities to change their value which is where this comes in you can actually just say a person. name and assign any sort of value you can put anything inside there and it will assign it directly unconditionally the problems of doing this is someone might expose it to null by accident and some wearing your code if you're using something like equals this will actually prevent an exception of course you can wrap this inside a TR catch but this is unnecessary because we can prevent this in the first place it's always best to prevent an exception than to put additional code in like a TR catch in order to catch something that you can prevent in the first place prevention is definitely better than the Cure in this case so having something like a person. name being exposed it's not so much for the integer because integers will always have number values whereas strings they can be initialized to null there is no such thing as null in our age that our default value for an integer is zero so we don't really have the same issue we started introducing the name function and the age function these are used so we can control what Val values get assigned to our local variables and we also have our get functions get name and get age so let's explore how these are made inside our Cass and expand on that and see how they work so first we need to make sure that our variables are actually private they're private so we can't access them just like this if I copy and paste this line above you'll see we're going to get a compile error and this error is because we can't actually use it because as it says here it's inaccessible due to its protection level and the protection level comes from the fact that this is indeed private it's private so it's only accessible within class person so every reference to name can be used inside here just not outside so the only way to be able to change the name now you've made it private is by enforcing this function the good thing about this function is we can check if the value is invalid and then we can star it if it's valid and then change it to something else if it's invalid and then we can wrap this if statement around in a conditional Operator just to make it a little bit shorter and in order to retrieve an name because now that it made it public we can neither set or retrieve it so we have our get name function that simply just returns it back to the screen nothing special here and the same thing for our set age we can check if the age is between 0 and 150 and assign it and if it's not assign it to minus one and then again wrap it around in our conditional operator and then for our get age we can just return age I demonstrated our functions inside here you can take all of these on line functions and actually add them all in one line without the need of cly Braes if you want to return back in age then you simply just type in age just like you can see here and here when you do assignment you want to specify this.name equals but when you're doing returns you just need to type in the variable that you need of course this looks a little bit cleaner and a bit shorter but not Everyone likes this notation so it's completely up to the developer or the environment that you're working in and finally we just have our return details and then we can make use of them just like this by using person which is the name of our local variable for new instance followed by a DOT and then set name set age and then get name and then get age so now that we're dealing with classes it's important you focus on the scope we have a person person here that's defined within the main which means it's only Within These two curly braces so if we had a static void and a function that did something inside here we can't access person inside here if we take out the comment and we try it the only reference we have is accessing the class directly not this local variable if you want to access local variable from inside this function then you'd simply have to pass it in like this and then it'll finally become available as you can see now there's two and it says as a parameter and the same goes for this class above just because we have name and age up here it doesn't necessarily mean that we can magically use name down here if we have something like a static int defined right here then we can use this integer inside these function functions as it says there it's available we can sign that to 10 and it's also down here available and we can sign that one to 20 and you'll see we have no compil errors but if we take this and put it inside our return details function then you're going to get an exception because X is not available within that scope and the functional scope matters inside here as well if you have a string test inside here we can just access it in another function for example the Constructor we can't just print out test as a screen the handy or classes if you want variables to be available throughout the class then you put them at the top we can have that private string test and there you go you see that the compil error is now gone and we can give that initial value and then you can use that to print to the screen Etc and just to note when you have a variable that's called exactly the same thing we have a private string test up here and we can say hello and then we also have a string test down here so let me demonstrate what happens when two variables are the same so let's let's move this into our Constructor so if we run this as it is we test equals hello and then we print out test and then run the code there you go we get hello printed and just ignore this this is from the return details function as we've got in the main down here return details so we've made our new Constructor and then assigned it the value with abber and 23 and then we can get hello printed to the screen but let's say we actually made a string test inside here and we said hi instead of hello then which one you think get use the global one or the local one let's run it and find out it's actually the local one the compiler will always prioritize the local variables over the global variables and this is the reason why you need to type this dot because when you use name it's always going to reference the parameter when it's name on its own use console right line and say name and then if we do after this line and another console right line and we say this. name then these are completely different this one is the parameter and this one is talking about the variables from the class and these are known as our Fields local variables take presidence over our Fields as long as they're called the same thing as you can see now it says it's assigned but the value is never used if you take the string test out then you can see it's now being used there you go hello gets printed out to the screen and there you go the green line has went because we're using it down here scope is very important when you're designing these classes and just to note that the variables that are available inside here are not going to be necessarily available inside here unless you make them public and even when you make them public that doesn't necessarily mean that this is still available magically over here name will only be available through an instance of the person class so if we do person. name now we can see that that's available as our field so that's why that makes it public if we try and make this private again just to return that value back and we scroll down you'll see now we get a compile error because it's inaccessible because it's outside the scope because it's now a private variable so we've covered what it means to have a public or a private field if you have a private field then you're going to have to use Setters and gets in order to work with this field if you make it directly public then you won't need any Setters and gets because the user can just type iname after their public instance so you can have person followed by the dot and right now you can't see name inside here and the blue slittle icon is no longer there the reason why it's not there is cuz there's no public Fields if we then change this to public remove the dot and readit you'll see that our blue square is now back because our field is now accessible and we can assign that to anything that we want the whole point of making this private is your only restricted access so you know what you're doing and the reason why I say that that is if they enter something that's invalid then we want to specify something like invalid if we give them Public Access then we're not going to know and we won't be able to validate what they've entered so in order to do it through a Setter we can make it private create our set function with a return type it's going to take in a string parameter and this string has to be the same data type as the parameter you're talking about call it name or whatever you want it to be and because these two are called exactly the same thing we have to use this dot so we're referencing this name instead of this name in the parameters and here we're just using a conditional operator and we're saying if the string is not null or empty hence the exclamation point then we assign it to name name gets put in this. name and if this were to return back false then we place invalid name straight into this. name and for the get we simply just return a string since that's a data type for name and then just return it back and it's that simple and the same thing for age we validate the age range set it and if it's outside this range we can set it to minus one so as you can see this is a bit long we have our private variables and then we have two functions one for set one for get and the same thing for age so these are called fields and gets and Setters so I'm going to introduce a notion called properties and properties make it easier to do this exact notation so let's now see how properties created since these fields are private we need to make something that's actually public so we can do something like this we can say public string and we can say name with a capital N so now you can see that name and name are not actually clashing and we can assign that in here should we want to and you see we don't need this dot anymore because this is now different it's a capital N so this one always references this and this references this so we need to add something else onto here so if you create them both now you can see we can do age equals age and there'll be no problems with this so now that we've made our two new Fields so now we have our two new public variables which are known as our Fields let's see how we can turn them into properties so if you remove the semicolon you can actually add in some curly braces so inside here we need a getter and Setter just like we had down there but we have a quick Ann notation for it instead of making two distinct functions you can actually create a little section inside these curly BRAC to get and set the name so you got to think of this as a middleman the same way this is a middleman we call this function and this function will affect the name and this is going to be the same principle we make use of name with a capital N but it will actually be affecting the lowercase n variable these are going to be our new middle mans and they will directly replace the gets and sets here so what we can do in here is we can say get press enter go on the next line and make some cly braces and then we can also have a set so this is like our mini get and mini set function just like we've got here by as you can see it's a lot shorter we don't need to give it a distinct name or set the public or anything else we just give it a simple set and get so if you have a look at the compile error it says not all call Path return of value because as it says here this get function is actually a mini function built into this property person. name which is our name with a capital N and then it's do get and this returns back a string so if we actually just type in return this then it gets rid of the compiler error but of course we don't want to return nothing we actually want to return name because remember what I said string name and intage up here is our private field they actually start the data the public string name and the public in age is the middleman that coordinates all of the gets and sets to do with the private variables so for the set just for now we can say name equals and then what do we give it the value of so if we hover over set it doesn't actually give you any indication of what it's going to be so let's have a look if we press control space then we don't also get the list of everything that we can add inside here now it's very difficult to understand what to assign this to when we have set name we've gave it a string name parameter so we can use name down here so what's our parameter in this case well the function itself doesn't actually tell us but I'm telling you right now that the parameter is actually just called value and this is a very default parameter that you'll see everywhere when you doing gets and sets inside a property you don't have to specify value or anything it just gets simply assigned in just like here where we have string name this will be a string value so it will look something like this behind the scenes but of course you can't actually type this in cuz remember these properties are trying to give you a short hand on how to do gets and Setters so you just got to remember that when you trying to set you get the property inserted as value so you can startall that into name so that's it the name is actually sorted now so before we do the same thing for age let's see how we can use this inside the code so we scroll down to our main we have a person person and then we have a console right line that prints the details so we can actually do person Dot and you can see now that it's slightly different if you ignore the age since that's returned back as a field since we haven't done that yet you'll see that name now has a little Cog next to it show only properties this is a new icon that we haven't saw yet so this is our new icon it says it's going to return us back with the string and we can actually execute a get and execute a set straight on this name then we can say name equals Harry and we don't get any compiler errors whatsoever this lets us do it completely so now if we do another console right line and we say person do return details and let's run that and you should see that the name gets changed there we go ABA gets changed to hurry perfect so after we've got person. name let's see how we can also get the value so we can just say string interpolation your name is and then we do person and followed by a DOT and as you can see the exact same list that we got given over here is given right here as well name also says get and set and it returns back a property which is a string type so we can open like this and you'll notice that we don't have the parentheses after it and the reason for that is because the brackets indicate that you're calling a function but a property is just a property it's almost like a variable so you're not actually needing to put any brackets after it because there's no function to call so as you can see this is exactly the same as this in this case we're actually setting the value and in this case we're actually getting the value so let's comment this line out and let's see what happens your name is Harry so that's worked okay so now let's do the same thing for age remove the semicolon add the curly brace we can say get and then return age and then simply do set and then do age equals value there we go so now we got that set up if we return back down here and we see person dot so as you can see now the age is being removed as being a field as we saw in the blue icon it's now being turned into a spanner which means it's a property as shown here show only properties so now you can see it returns back an integer and we've got a get in a set so we can set that to 25 for example and then we can append onto here and your AG is person. AG you see that it's a couple a just as this one is a capital N and now we have get and set available and again we don't need the brackets inside here since this is a property not a function now let's run it we should see Harry 25 there you go your name is Harry and your age is 25 perfect so as you can see now is instead of having our set name and get name which are these two functions we actually have them contained within a property we call this property and it affects these variables but as you can see just as these functions below were a middleman we've now moved the middleman into these properties so as these are only one line you're probably thinking there's probably a better way of doing this and it's a lot quicker for syntax and you're right there is so let's explore that so I said before about Arrow functions when you're doing something like this get name you can have public string get name and then you can simply do Arrow name and this is a very common string function get name that just returns back a value and you can make that into an arrow function by literally just putting back name so we can actually do the same thing but for our properties so these both contain one line so we can actually minimize this and if we just block comment this out we can say public string name and then we can have get and then the same thing with the arrow function when we're doing Arrow function down here you would simply won't use the return keyword you would just type in the variable you want to return so we can say get arrow and then simply low case name and then add a semicolon just so you know that that section is ended and then straight after we can have set and then arrow and then name equals value just like that so as you can see these contents are exactly the same we've actually return them back in a short space and of course here as we got a compile error it just expects a semic callon to be right at the end here there you go and now we do the same thing for our age we can do public int age get Arrow age and set Arrow age equals value perfect so now you can see that this has been drastically reduced if I cut this just underneath you'll see that almost all of these lines are just replaced in a two and you'll see that our functionality will still work exactly the same if we just run the code Harry and 25 is being reassigned over our default variables perfect of course now if you want to add some more functionality inside here for example in our set name we had a little check that makes sure that it's a valid name before we assign it so we actually take this and paste it over here then you see the lines grown quite a lot so what's PR to do is if you're going to have any data inside here that does a little bit of logic then it's best to keep the curly braces since you can have a bigger output and it looks a bit more sensible if you just simply getting and you're setting the variables then you can leave this notation so let's undo this and bring back the original ones in this case there we go and then we can take that line and in the set we can actually replace it here so as you can see this is a little bit grayed out so let's put the semicon at the end and let's see why this is grayed out name can be simplified so what we're doing now is name and all of these variables are actually looking at the private variable whereas if you actually look down here and we uncomment this you'll see that set name if we double click on this one this is the only reference to it which is our private variable appear and the reason why this doesn't need to be used in this case is because our parameter is now called value so it's saying the name is equal to checking if the value is null or empty assigning the value into name if not and then if it is empty then we assign invalid straight into name in the case of our set name our name was our parameter the same goes here if we change this to Value we can change these two for Value as you can see now this dot is actually grayed out and it can be simplified to just simply name and the same principle applies above so let's comment these back out and scroll back to the top so now that we've assigned name there we go we've got our check inside there and you can also leave this on one line if you want you can even drop the curly brace in just so it looks like this instead of having it all on one line so you could do this and this would be applicable as well but the second you start to put it all on one line then it gets a little bit messy quickly so if you leave the outer bracket just like that then you can can be pretty short since you don't need more curly braces so now that we've done that for the name let's do it for the age as well so we had this. age we check the range and we assign the relevant values so let's take that paste it over this we don't need this dot anymore and age in this case is actually going to be the value gets passed in so replace all the ages with value there we go so if the value passes the range check we put the value inside age or not we can put minus one Inside Edge and again we can have the same thing we can use our arrows inside here there we go so now we've got our code drastically reduced so we went from these big functions that have to be defined with specific names over to our properties and they went from really small to just a little bit bigger but now they have advanced connections just to make sure that the variables are okay before you assign it in so now that we've got our properties let's have a look so inside our Constructor we we don't also need to use our local variables which is our private ones directly we should actually get rid of this now and we should always do everything through our properties name equals name and because this is a capital and this is a lower case we don't need this dot in there there we go so what you should do in the return details function is also use the capital n and the capital age so when you hover over these you're actually referring to the property because like I said before these are the middleman to communicate with the private variables you shouldn't need to access the private variables directly you should use the middleman as much as possible so now that we've done that I have one last thing to introduce so if we actually abandon all of this code just to keep it for reference we have something called an auto property and you briefly saw it when we saw it down here so if we actually just bring them back for a second and if you hover over a name down here it says string name get and set in the Cur C brace but you see how the get and set is empty it just has two values inside there and it just ends a curly brace with no actual logic you see in our get we're saying age and our set we're saying age equals this so when we're doing Auto properties what you can do is you can actually make these public again change these to a capital N changes to a capital A and just straight after it you can say Get Set just like that and what that will do is although they're actually made public what it's doing behind the scenes is actually doing this for you it actually has a private and a public for you behind the scenes this is just a Shand these are what's called a auto property what it does is it makes an anonymous property behind the scenes as I'll show you in Microsoft documentation right now as it says here in CP 3 or later Auto implemented properties make property declaration more concise when no addition logic is required and what that means is no additional logic all of these are additional logic if you just simply assigning a value and reading it back just like here then this is no need to write get name and set name if all you're doing is getting and setting it if you're getting and setting it but there is a certain amount of logic as we have here we essentially have a conditional operator that's making a subconscious decision about what to assign the name to but if you just simply assigning something like this then an auto property is perfect they also enable client code to create objects when you declare a property as shown in the following example the compiler creates a private Anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties get and Setters as you can see here just like in our example we have public int something and then get and set and then they have a public in something with the get and set as well and they can use it just here to access it directly and because they're simply just assigned and getting the values and there isn't any additional logic then this is the best way to do it and you get as it says here an anonymous private backing field so this would be the same thing as doing this private string name and private int AG so once you do that and you make this into the get and set properties which are these two right here this and this line together make a property what the auto implement the property does is actually combine this line and this line together and make the private one behind the scenes so the programmer doesn't see it but it will be applicable when the program runs in the compiler and then you only get publicly exposed with this parameter which will be our name property so it will actually make the private for you if you just keep it like we had it a second ago just like this so if you leave it like this it will actually create the private variable behind the scenes as it says here it's Anonymous backing field and it can only be accessed through name and age and as you can see none of our code has actually changed all of these still function okay and if we run the code we should still get Harry and 25 so just to sum this video up since there was a lot covered the bottom line is if you're going to have any sort of values that require any logic then you should use normal properties if you're simply just going to assign and get the value and it doesn't matter and you have no control over it then you can use the auto implemented properties since that will do the same thing with less code using the gets and Setters is the old way of doing this and you should always use the properties going forward Getters and Setters are very helpful to know just so you understand what they are and why they exist but you should not that properties are the best way forward properties give you access to doing the same logic as it says inside here if you do an auto-implemented properties then you're not allowed to use the logic inside the set or the get so if you don't want to do any logic then don't use the AL implemented properties only use the normal properties to make a get and Setter you just do set name get the parameter and assign the local variable and the get just returns it getting back a property you want to capitalize your private variable if you had private string name with a lowercase n you want public string name with a capital N you get the name and then you can set the name with some sort of conditional operator or any if statement or anything inside here and the same thing goes with the age you can have a public int age with a capital a and a private end age with a lowas here you can get the age and then set the age with a conditional operator again or any other code if you don't require any logic like these two lines indicate then you can simply just use the auto properties as demonstrated above here and they can be used quite easily throughout the Constructor and our functions and even outside the function when the user is trying to call them but one thing that we haven't been able to solve and you may not have noticed this as a nuisance the problem is when you trying to return details about something we're having to call this function every single time if we have an INT age for example and made that equal to 23 and we did consle right line and simply placed age inside the brackets we don't have to do anything like this because it simply just prints the value out if we run the code you'll see that it simply just says 23 this should be pretty simple for our person as well but it's not we need to call return details every single time we want to print the properties and if we don't do this the only way to do it is is by making some string interpolation and we can say person. name and then also include person. AG Etc and then that can print out to the screen just like that of course it doesn't have the same format in but we can also just take this place it straight inside here add our person dot before them person Dot and there you go then you get exactly the same output as call and return details but of course you don't want to do this every time and you certainly don't want to have to type type in return details function every single time as well you want to keep it as just person now of course this is not going to work straight out the box let's try run that and see what happens so we get string override. person and what's going on here is it's saying namespace is string override and then it's a class person so it's just printing out this person object but it's not really doing anything because we haven't really told it to do something so what we can do here is we can actually override the two string method so let me explain so let me set up a couple of examples just to show you what's going to happen at the end so right now we call return details to return these details what we can also do is say do two string and then we can also do these three options return the details convert it to a string or just print the person straight to the console at the end of this little section we're going to make all three of these print out the same values so let's have a look now two string and printing out normally these two lines right here are actually doing exactly the same thing behind the scenes when you place anything inside these brackets inside a console right line it will try and convert it to a string anywhere so whether you put to a string or you leave it as person the console right line function will still accept it so let just comment out the age for the time being in order to make the two string function work as well as just ping person inside the brackets we need to make a special function which is an override function so let's have a look so just underneath our return details still within the scope of the class would say public and then override after we press tab we can follow it by a space and we can see the functions that we can override so in this video we're actually going to cover two string and equals get hash code will actually serve as a default hash function if I show you the documentation it says here a hash code is numeric value that is used to insert an identify an object in a hash based collection this is normally used when you doing hash functions as it says here and for the time being we're not actually going to be using this right now so the two we can do are two string and equals but as you can see our two string is available right now we'll cover equals as an extension in a minute so let's double click on our two string and we get this little template placed in if you don't want the template then it's just an override it returns back a string since it's converting to string it needs to be this exact notation if you drop the T then it's got nothing to override now you go be a compil error cuz there's nothing to override itself so play two string the capitals there's no parameters passed in and then we're going to be returning something so the thing that we're going to be returning is exactly the same as our return details function we actually have two options here we could say return and then return details so what that will do is it will go to this function it will call this function grab that and essentially place inside here and then return it back to the console in the ideal world we don't actually need this return details function so we could comment it out but I'm going to leave it in just so the demonstration doesn't break down here so we can take this and place it straight inside here now we have two functions that essentially do the same thing thing but the advantage is this function is something that needs to be called explicitly do return details whereas this function the two string override actually just gets called naturally without having to add any extensions so if you run the code now you'll see that now the all equal exactly the same value we get three sections that have this maybe we can place back SLT instead just so we can have them all in the same line there we go so you can see all three are exactly the same so what we can do now is if we comment this option and we comment out this function we don't have to include two string if we don't want to we can also comment this one out and we can keep it just as person so as we do when we declare the integer we say inage equals 23 and then we simply print out and this is exactly the notation that we want it should really be this simple there you go one line creates the person and one line with just a variable name goes inside the brackets to print them out the same thing here person person age and age and let's run that code now and there you go you get the person printed and the age printed exactly and straightforward as you may think it should be so now that we've done that let's explore what the equals function needs to be done let's make another person we can say person test equals new person and we can have hurry age 23 now we don't need to print them out in this example we just need to demonstrate this equals function so if you remember with strings we can have a string called Abba for example and we can say do equals straight after it we can say if ABA is equal to Harry then we can do something inside here what I'm trying to demonstrate is once you've got an object you can place do equals and then you can compare it like that so you can also do that with our classes so we can say person do equals and then equals to test and in here we could just say same let's try and make these as same as possible and see what happens so let's keep the name exactly the same just like that and let's copy the 25 down just like that so now these two are instantiated exactly the same way let's see what happens when we've run the equals then we don't get anything printed which means they're not the same so because this doesn't automatically tell us that these two are exactly the same we can override that and provide our own functionality just like we did with the operate overload we override equals we get passed in an object and we need to check something inside it so let's see what we can do inside here so in order to check if something is equal to another thing what can we do so we have a name and an age if this one is the same as this and this is the same as this then two people are exactly the same so let's try that out and see what happens so we can say name which is the property inside the class that we're currently inside and then we can use equals because this is just a string parameter and then we can say that equals to objectname but you can see we've got a little problem here this object is very generic it's just an object every class that you create is derived by an object what that means is every class or integer or double at the end of the day is also just known as an object through inheritance which we'll discuss further on this course but just know that everything inside C is always an object somewhere down the line so what that means is we have to convert it from an object to our custom class which is person in this case so we can use this thing called casting so we can say person person which is just Define a new variable and we can make that immediately equal to object as person so what we've done here is we've said our object which is this parameter is currently an object right now we want to cast it as a person which is kind of like converting into a person and then placing the values inside here so now if we get rid of this comment and instead of using object we actually have a new local variable called person so then here we can say personname there we go now we have access to the person property since we've converted this object into a person and of course we know that we have name and age available so if the name is equal to the person. name and the age is equal to the person. age then we must have a match and of course you want to keep using the properties we're going to use a capital A and there we go so we run the conversion on one line and then we check if they're equal to each other now in this specific case you can actually pass anything inside here so let's try it we can pass five into idea and as you can see there's no compile error cuz like I said five is just an integer which is an object at the endend of the day if you make it a double that works as well there is literally no compile errors and even if you put M to make it into a decimal again there's no compile errors because they're all objects at the end of the day so let's pass Tes in there what you will have to know is if you do accident pass in a double for example like this you're going to hit an error here which will be a runtime error it will try and convert it as soon as it hits this line and obviously you can't convert a double into our person so what you could do just to wrap it around you could say if the object is a person then we can proceed with a conversion just like this and then what you can do for safety is just outside of this you can actually just return back false just so the user knows that this isn't equal to each other so if the object is a person then we convert it as a person is is used for checking and as is used for converting is this object a person and if it is then we try and convert it and then return back if they're equal to each other and if we accidentally pass something in that's not a person then we just return back false so let's just demonstrate this first not the same so let's just save five inside here it says not the same so let's actually go into this place a break point and let's run it again hover over object then we get five if we place this straight inside the watch you can see object is person is returning back false so it's skipping this entire function and going into return false and then it's returning back false so we get not same let's stop the program change this over to test and rerun it using F5 and now we can see object is person is actually set to true so now if we put the object inside here you can see that generically it's an object right here it says object so what we can do now is we can place person and down here as well you see that person doesn't exist but if you just give it a second it we change this to just the p there we go so obviously the person doesn't exist cuz we're only up to this line we press F10 and F10 again so now it's create a the variable and F10 wants to skip over it and now you can see the object has went from type object to type string. override. person string overwrite is the name of our namespace and do person with a capital P is the name of our class now you can see that the object and the values are exactly the same 25 ab and 25 AB as you can see right here so now both of them are exactly equal to each other so when we check this name here is Aba name here is Aba age 25 and age is 25 so this must return back true and we can check that by highlighting everything dragging and dropping it down here and we can see it says true there so when it returns back to our code it's going to go and print their same perfect there you go so that's it for this video but let's just have a recap before we wrap up so before this video we'd always print the details out like this person. return details but obviously we don't have that function anymore so let's just bring it back quickly there we go so we use return details and this is just a bit long have to do this every single time if you want to print the details of the test object as well you have to test Dot and then return details again it'd be so much easier if we could simply just use it like this as you would do with a normal variable like an integer double A String Etc and now it's made possible by using our public override string two string function it will contain exactly the same contents as our previous function except we won't have to go through an additional function just to print out the details we can override the two string and then we can call it straight in the console like this and finally when you're doing equals inside an object you can actually build in some custom functionality we can convert the person using object as person but first before doing the conversion you want to check if the object is indeed a person type before doing the conversion this will give you a runtime error on this line so let me just demonstr that before we continue so if I comment out this one and actually just change this into 5D and then let's press into the code right here it's going to hit this line if I press F10 then it's going to try and convert it but you're going to get back null and then if you run the code again then you're get an exception thrown here you're going to get a runtime exception because it's a null reference we're trying to run the equals function on something that is null which is right here null reference exception so you shouldn't do this you you should also make sure that these are correct values before doing it this is a form of error checking if you don't do this then you're going to have to wrap this inside a tri catch and it will look something like this and the cord will be considerably longer you can place these two lines inside here and then place your cat inside here etc etc and you can return false inside here but as you can see the Cod is a bit more complicated now and there's no reason for this extra complication if you can prevent it with an if statement so undo that so what's best in this case is to say if the object is of type person then we can run the conversion if you run the conversion and it's not of type person then as you can see it's going to return back null for the person and then when you run this line it's actually going to return you back a null reference exception at this point but anyway the whole point of this equals is to check if two objects are going to be equal to each other so we keep this back to test because this is a custom classes you can't just simply do person equals equals time test and assume that that will just work these aren't buil-in functionalities for custom classes we covered operate overloading where you can actually overload what you do with the equal sign but we didn't cover the dot equals which is what we're doing today in this video as well as the two string this is a different kind of overriding because in the other one when we're doing operator overloading that's specifically an operator that you're just changing the parameters of whereas this one is a strict override of a function equals and the functions two string this will make it easier to print your custom classes out to the screen as well as comparing them just like this person. equals putting test inside the bracket is a lot easier and quicker and you can build in your own custom functionality if you only had the age in there then you can compare the age maybe have a lot more properties and you can always just chain them inside a big if statement that's fine as well but the point is you have full control over how you compare your custom classes maybe you had a list of names inside a dictionary for example and you wanted to add a new name or a new age or a new user to this dictionary but first before you add a new user to the dictionary you want to check if the user already exists so maybe you could have a system where it uses the equals function and it Loops through all of the dictionary items and it checks if all the values are not equal to this one if you didn't build in this functionality so you could do the do equals function then you won't be able to determine if this one is equal to this one and now with your equals function overrided you can now have the functionality to do so thank you for watching this C course I hope you found it helpful in your journey to

      "[Document(page_content=\"[Music] welcome back to the freeco camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freeco camp.org and each week we're bringing you Insight from developers entrepreneurs and ambitious people who are getting into Tech this week we're joined by Seth golden he's an open source project maintainer developer a prolific Freo Camp contributor and he is a computer science student at Yale welcome Seth thank you for having me Quincy yeah it's great to have you here man uh you're somebody whom I've enjoyed talking with for years at this point and you have a very special relationship with a gentleman whom uh has who has also contributed a lot to freeo Camp uh Sam cromby and I wanted to start by just going back in time a few years to how you met Sam yeah so Sam and I actually met we're both originally from South Florida and we met through a mutual friend uh Joe who also one of my really good friends and they were working together on a project and Joe and I had worked together on a project and somehow Sam and I got connected and we all have this interest in edtech and that's education technology and so it just like immediately like hit it off um and our first big project together Sam and I was we recognized that there's this amazing wealth of resources that exist on the internet which is the fact that like most college CS curriculums are available online for free publicly yeah and at the time we saw that these were courses that were just being passed around on like Reddit through like Google Sheets like people would be sharing like Google Sheets of like these are all the Stanford CS courses or these are all the MIT CS courses and we were like okay we could probably build better interface than Google Sheets via Reddit post um for like just sort of agglomerating and collecting all of those resources to make them more accessible to people make it easier to find so that was our first project that we worked on together and college compendium dorg again a giant directory of uh online courses that you can take in most cases for free uh through various universities including you know many any prestigious universities like Yale um so uh tell me a little bit about how you two met like what were the circumstances were were you working on similar projects or did you just bump into each other at a party it wasn't a party I was working on an academic information system for the school district of pompage County at the time and Sam and Joe were working on a hallpass system during Co so like a digital Hall Pass solution and there was just a lot of overlap in our interests we got connected and started talking um and what actually ended up happening was the that project uh compendium which isn't like super mantained but there's still a lot of amazing resources that are on that website for free still today um was we learned a lot about like a lot of the challenges that exist with auditing courses online and so that's how we made our first fre code Camp course was we recognized that there are a lot of like sort of tips and tricks that you can use to help yourself get through a lot of these courses that we had discovered through our process of auditing CS courses like Berkeley 61b for example is a really famous yeah example um and you know over the years Sam and I looked at ml courses NLP courses data structure learning natural language processing yeah I'm sorry I'm just going to like there are lots of acronyms used in computer science CS true just if I interject occasionally it's just to make sure that everybody in the audience knows what we're talking about here of course so we thought that that could be a really like useful addition to the free code Camp community and it seems like it was it was oh yeah absolutely like hundreds of thousands of people have watched the auditing course and we weren't sure at the time are people really that interested in formally auditing a university course when they could just just go watch Like You Know video recordings of courses uh or uh do like the you know the online course version of it through like you know corsera or edex or something like that but it turns out there's a lot of interest among developers in the freeo camp community so yeah thanks for making that course of course it's something that we're really proud of and I think a lot of the things that we did after that were a reflection of what that experience taught us which is it's really challenging to finish a course online like learning online is really hard and so the next thing that we worked on samon was this tool that we were trying to build to help people um get through courses like sort of a digital ta which was like a very very early version of chat GPT using gpt3 to create basically a chatbot um in like April of 2022 I think it was um um and so a fun story actually is I ended up skipping my graduation for high school to fly to Dartmouth for like a pitch competition that was happening there um yeah Dartmouth being the school that Sam just graduated from Recently but this was back your high school graduation yeah so that we could um like pitch this new idea and get started on working on it and that eventually turned into a tool that Joe ended up joining us for and the three of us worked together on it for about a year um eventually it being called Friday Friday like like his girl Friday like the idea of a chatot that can help guide you through uh a whole lot of um you know struggles that you might encounter trying to get through these courses right yeah and it was an incredible experience to work on that with the two of them and hopefully it helped a lot of students we had a lot of students using it um over the span of the last year so I think like in general when I think about sort of courses and and auditing courses like it has never been easier to do that than it is today with tools like Chachi PT and all of these advances recently in large language models like even taking courses in person um it's sort of like a a massive step forward that it's difficult to imagine what life was like before these tools existed like yeah I find myself constantly asking questions now that I know I'm going to get like a quick response to that makes sense and is thorough that like a Google search wouldn't have provided um you know as as succinct C or as as explanatory um before and that's actually probably a good segue into the second course that we worked on yes and uh just just to be clear we're going to talk a lot about AI that's going to be a huge thing we talk about later but I I want to hear about like one of the earlier versions of AI uh Google search itself I mean the p rank algorithm and all the additional software they've layered on top of it is this Tool uh that I mean where does the AI really begin I mean it it used to just be if then logic and now it's it's neural networks and things like that but somewhere in between was Google search and Google search still is incredibly useful I use it I don't know 50 times a day probably that's not an exaggeration but I also use llms uh I use uh GPT 4 a lot um especially for language learning as I've talked a little bit about in previous episodes of the free C Camp podcast but maybe you could talk a little bit about your course on Google searching this technology that's been with us for like 20 plus years that a lot of people take for granted like don't you just type what you want no all right you don't just type what you want there's a whole lot of different um kind of tactics you can use to get what you want out of Google right yeah I mean that's something that over the the years like we had picked up uh a lot of sort of tips and tricks about using Google search to like more quickly more accurately find what you're looking for like sure you can just sort of type into the search bar or anything and Google's really good at finding what it is that you're looking for and not just Google search endom in general like that's what they're meant to do um but there are a lot of like operators that you can add to your query to make it more accurately find what you're looking for especially when you're programming and you're looking to like debug this like one error that you can't figure out and you're trying to find that like one stack Overflow post or GitHub Forum comment that like solves your problem uh something as simple as just like putting quotations around like the specific thing that you're looking for so that an exact matth searches for it I use that like every day that's a um like worth it to watch the first five minutes of that course if you didn't know that was a thing that existed and there's a lot of operators like that that I think I find really valuable I think another like that course was sort of a combination of a bunch of things like it was like anything that could possibly be useful to you about Google was how Google used to work how Google works today to our best understanding a lot of these operators that you can use and then also just like strategies for when you're searching like this I think becomes Al it's it remains relevant even in a world of large language models in that like it's still all about how you prompt the model like the the question that you ask is just as important as what it is that you're trying to find like you sort of have to imagine like what it is that you're trying to end up with and then craft a prompt or a query that you think will best result in that result versus that just sort of like putting in like a question um and mlms are pretty good at answering those things too large langu it's also yeah yeah very much about Sor sorry I just wanted to jump in just in case anybody doesn't know that acronym yet you're going to hear that a lot over the next few years large language models llms uh just just to kind of like recapitulate what you just said communication is ultimately what this is and programming is communicating what is in your head to a computer right Google searching effectively is communicating what you want to a computer uh prompt engineering if you want to call it that like essentially The Art of Getting an llm to tell you what or give you the information that you need right or do the task that you needed to do it it's all about communicating and the way that you communicate with a human uh a native English speaking human that grew up with similar cultural context to you and everything like that like you grew up in South Florida I grew up in Oklahoma like the way you and I would communicate is very different from how you would communicate with Google or you would communicate with gp4 right uh so so the tactics that you use to effectively communicate and and get the machine to do your bidding essentially that's that's what your Google course is about right yeah and I think like the thing is the end goal I I think at least is for for the way that we interact with computers to be exactly the same as the way we interact with other people that that is possible and like eventually something that I mean just makes the most intuitive sense like that's what programming is I would agree to point however like it with a human you do have to kind of be polite you don't have to be polite to a computer a computer does not care about politeness that's true uh if you look at like and I always you know I'm a huge Star Trek fan especially the Next Generation which is my my personal favorite uh but I I'm I I'm working through like dpace 9 and I enjoyed Voyager and stuff too but um if you look at how they talk to a computer it's incredibly uh imperative but it's also very declarative in the sense that like they're telling the computer exactly what to do but the computer is also able to kind of make inductive leaps and figure out oh they probably meant this or this but the way they talk to the computer is not like hey how are you doing computer could you please do this they're just like computer XYZ you know and the computer goes and does it so in a way like communicating with a computer that doesn't have feelings doesn't care about like doesn't have a physical form doesn't have all these different considerations emotions that the humans have it can be much more efficient and direct and you can give it like you could just give it a big line of like code essentially instead like where it would take forever to like articulate exactly what you want code can be much more succinct in some instance for explaining what you want to be done so while I agree that you know there's this book called snow crash that I read when I was a kid and he has like a librarian and he has these conversations with the librarian and the librarian teaches him everything he needs to know about whatever topic he's is is relevant kind of just in time learning and stuff like I can definitely understand like a computer embodied in kind of like a hologram or something that that has like a role like oh I want Mark Twain to be my my professor or something like that right at the same time there's a of value in just treating the computer like a computer and just saying you're Google you do this go do this now you know this is how you get things done you know and and understanding why the computer does what it does how it does like you were saying like understanding how Google has changed over time the more understanding you have of the tool the more you can kind of empathize with the tool and what it's trying to do and and kind you have that kind of theory of mind for the computer you're interacting with right yeah I mean I think what you're talking about in terms of proactivity is really interesting to me um we can talk more about proactive Computing and also contextual Computing which is something I'm super interested in right now later in this I've never even heard the term proactive Computing can you tell me what that is real quick just so proactive in contextual Computing is this idea that very soon we're going to be able to use information that we have about people um like context on for example the transcript of this podcast or like screenshots from your computer and also like be able to just start doing things for you I don't like this is starting to get sort of sci-fi but if you've seen like even like some of the Marvel movies or her with walking Phoenix and Scarlet excellent movie yeah these are ideas of having AI assistants that are capable of doing things for you without you asking asking them to do that which doesn't really exist yet you still have to like hold down and say Hey Siri which I just triggered Siri but like you have to ask for things still you have to ask chat gbt to do XYZ for you in the next couple years I think what we'll start to see is these assistants will like send you a notification and be like based on the conversation you just had like XYZ or like hey Quincy I just finished um you know listening to your podcast recording I edited you know these things and I'm ready to upload it when you are and then you just click like yes and then it does it for you and like sort of automating tasks that you don't necessarily need to do yourself is something that we can start to see over time so proactive contextual Computing like really cool yeah what you were talking about before though um about programming I mean I feel like that's what programming is is it's a sort of more human version of machine code like it's a way for like levels of abstraction that we're able to use like something like python for example is like a lot closer to natural language than something like assembly or C um so like I find that really interesting too is is the ways in which we're communicating with computers already starting to have more of that natural language element to it and it'll be interesting to see like what future programming angues look like um given that we now have this ability to sort of compile cross languages um with like large language models and so on or or at least that that will get better and better over time something I want to ask you actually is what you sort of think the future of this world looks like the future of programming the future of online education given that we have all of these new opportunities and resources that didn't exist like a year or two ago in the same way and that are constantly getting faster and more accurate and less expensive yeah I mean I I think the vision of The Librarian from Snow Crash is is pretty apt uh you know it's it's like a 30-year-old novel maybe um but it's I mean it given the Computing resources given the amount of instructional designers and teachers and subject matter experts and stuff who would compile their knowledge the movie Her which you mentioned the operating system that uh is voiced by uh gosh what's her name uh yeah scarjo um that is the product of like millions of programmers they say it like millions of programs have contributed code that ultimately went into this and if you think about it like you know a similarly complicated application like Google search for example may have at this point hundreds of thousands of contributors that have worked at Google over the years and worked on that right so we can see how all this software would get layered on top and and also if you consider all the content being absorbed legally or illegally we're we're not going to talk about that debate uh but you know the common crawl and every Wikipedia post every Reddit post every free C Camp Forum post of which there are hundreds of thousands you know being uh absorbed by GPT and uh you know thus in the great plagiarism engine that is them uh basically it could it could kind of reproduce this and and again I don't want to act like I don't want people to get the the vibe that like oh I think you know uh one way or another cuz my thoughts on it are very nuanced and complicated and they're still forming uh but as a human writer who's written hundreds of Articles over the years I'm probably subconsciously cribbing all kinds of stuff from The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or the Atlantic or the New Yorker or like all these other Publications that I've read over the years like different ways of saying things different ways of thinking and at what point was that an original thought you know who knows uh that that's almost like a philosophical discussion though it's not a programming and computer science question but what you asked about original yeah yeah is is anything original can we have different breakfast flavor cereals or have we tried them all or they all just variations of the same you know uh few tastes or something I don't know but what I will say is I think the idea of a tutor a one toone student ratio uh teacher ratio is pretty amazing and I think in some cases a t two or three student to one teacher kind of like if you go to a fancy school like yo you probably have like seminar courses where it's a very small number of Learners and one professor and you get that benefit of just being in a small group and having a lot of intelligent people asking questions that maybe you yourself wouldn't have thought to ask uh around you that is very good good too so I do think that we're going to continue to have classes where there're you know more than one student but I think a lot of education is going to be with a software system and let me be clear free Cod Camp is a software system free Cod Camp's Core Curriculum is essentially you could almost say like an AI in the sense that it's running your code it's evaluating it it's returning test information all the things it says are based on okay this condition didn't meet we didn't meet this condition and some instructional designer like you know Jessica or Naomi or Chris or one of the many people on our instructional design team has come up with like messages that help guide you almost like Socratic method did you mean to leave this you know uh this curly brace out or did you mean to uh not close your Loop or something like that right like like that's the the dream is asking you questions and guiding you toward the answer that you discover for yourself because that method of discovery that that moment burns into your memory like what you did wrong and that's one of the things about programming that's so amazing is you can sit there with a AI that's been built by thousands of contributors to free Cod camp and you can have an interaction and you can learn programming and the intelligence of all of those people is kind of like represented in the software that you're using that's guiding you to uh an understanding of how to write a sequel query or how how to write you know a python for Loop or something like that right so yeah yeah I I think that uh that's that's the future I it's an extremely broad question but but I think that's where things are heading is just having a extremely intelligent systems that people interact with in addition to you know I I don't think teachers are going to go away uh I I do think that classes are going to get smaller uh and I think they should get smaller because there's you know the only reason that you go to a public school and they 40 kids in there with one teacher is it's an economic necessity for all practical pedagogical reasons there should be like three students in there or one student you know I I just uh I and I think we're heading toward an area where there's such an abundance of resources that anyone who wants to learn anything will be able to free probably pull up something that's dedicated to teaching them that specific skill a lot of that may be video which is what you know your media uh has been recently uh with with the video courses the three video courses that you published on free C Camp and I still think that that's a great mode even though it's not interactive people can code along at home and they can spin up the server and they can you know clone your repo and they can do that and and that is some degree of interactive but I really think the gold standard where things are heading fully interactive fully like you know everything considered by a human teacher who has subject matter expertise and I I do think a lot of people are going to kind of paper over a lot of that human expertise by just like oh the AI can do it but the the AI is going to be mediocre frankly it's only going to be derivative it's not going to have the kind of flashes of insight that a human teacher has in my humble opinion and maybe eventually it will but we have no idea how soon that will come to be and we may be stuck in this Paradigm and things people may think things are going like this but they may actually be doing step changes you know we just experienced a step change so sorry this is not the let's interview Quincy Lon podcast I did not mean to just talk for a really long time but I I think a great deal about these things and I know you too what do you think yeah I mean well first of all like that that's why I came on the podcast is I wanted to hear your thoughts about all of this um I think that you're absolutely right that things are going to become more personalized um more generative um and then like what you were saying about like Interac gamified like I I think things are going to become more gamified in the same way that like like right now I use I use du lingo like every day um and you can debate how like effective that is at teaching you um like a language I use it as a supplement because I'm also taking a language course so it's just like it makes me feel good about myself to like do the Dual lingo every day but it's really effective at getting me to do it every day I'm at like a you know more than a year streak at this point um um and I think that that kind of sort of like dopamine pushing um like structure to a course could be like very effective in getting people to get through those um in a way that's also like more fun like for example like I took a bunch of courses online that were were like for credit for school and those courses were structured in a way where they were you would watch like 3 hours worth of videos and do like 20 Pages worth of readings or something and then you would answer a 10 question quiz and then you would repeat and to me that just feels like maybe not the most a missed opportunity man is it like what if the questions were sort of interspersed throughout all of that materials that you were being checked on how you understood it as you were going through it versus like right all at the end like I think structurally our education system hasn't changed a lot in a really long time and this is an opportunity to sort of revisit like first principles what is the purpose of Education how is like what is the most effective way to learn um and that could be different for different people I mean I personally find it a lot more entertaining and enjoyable to work on projects like when I'm when I'm trying to learn a CS course I prefer CS courses that you like you were discussing where I'm spinning up an environment and like doing something in real time while I'm watching the video versus like just like watching lecture for 10 hours and then doing something but someone else might prefer the latter so it's like what's really nice too is that there's a level of personalization that exists within auditing in the sense that you can just pick what's better for you and then do that you sort of get to pick and choose and build your own curriculum and something that Sam and I spent a lot of time thinking about was this idea of like Pathways that you could create your own that it didn't really auditing didn't stop after you finished one course then it became about okay now what course do I pick and then what course do I audit and what's really cool is that those courses can be from completely different places you don't have to lied to one school you're exactly I mean there are 5,000 universities just in the US right I mean frankly a lot of those are nothing to write home about but even if you look at like really good universities uh there's still hundreds of them and they have different professors who have different expertise in different subjects and there's a good chance that uh there are maybe like just a small handful of universities to teach a given topic that you're really interested in so by being able to audit you can draw from all of them and you can have the ultimate level of customization right absolutely yeah yeah so you think that uh building tooling around these Pathways which I've been very interested in the first project I built once I you know learned coding was basically uh after I'd worked as a software engineer for a while and I wanted to build my own first big project was basically that it would it would strap together a whole lot of different courses and books um and depending on what you wanted to learn and what you knew and it would like you'd sign in with LinkedIn it would read all your uh LinkedIn information including back then they had like these skills and you could have people like rank you for different or rate you for different skills oh I think Quincy knows sequel sure why not so you get like 99 people that like all think that Quincy knows squel you do you remember that on LinkedIn when they used to have the skills and it'd be like um but anyway it would pull in your LinkedIn I know I'm dating myself um and then it would just use that as the basis like oh okay so you want to go from what you know now to working in uh you know business intelligence right or or using like powerbi and different tools like that to like crunch charge and and figure out where to prioritize resources and stuff like that right like so okay well then you should read this book you should take this course and by the way there's like a critical path of dependencies essentially like you need to know this field of mathematics in order to do this type of programming you need to know this type of programming in order to you know use this type of software or something like that so there'd be like a dependency chain and it would work backward and it would create kind of like a a list of courses you should take but to some extent like how do you know those are the right courses you could build like a big engine and you could have like a you know a whole bunch of people rating the challenges yeah yeah um I think like if I were to do this in a a more structured way like not my University there's a lot of people who have already like made like public GitHub repositories doing exactly this where they're like okay I did like this course and then this course and then this course and this is how I felt about it and I probably check out a couple of those before like embarking on something is like sort of timec consuming and like commit commitment level I think is also for a long-term path a little bit higher than just like picking one course yeah but it's also like to some extent there's no commitment right like I think there's a lot of things I've bookmarked in my Chrome tabs where it's like I want to read this article one day or like I I don't know if you have a pocket for so many articles to pocket that I've never read um so I think that that's also a challenge is like how do you get from that crucial point of that looks interesting at some point I want to read this article or watch this video and my my YouTube watch later thing is like 400 videos that are like a lot of them are free code Camp courses I have to go and clear them out periodically because it just becomes meaningless like I just have this big heap of undifferentiated things that at one point I thought were a good idea to consume you know and I think like that's a good resource to have available and so the question then becomes like how do you sort of flick the switch go from zero to one of like okay I added this to something I want to do how do I actually start doing it and that is often like really just a matter of like personal drive to do something like how excited you are about it like if you're feeling like something is a chore it's not something that you like you're doing it for like because you think you should instead of because you want to it's a lot harder to do it and so at that point it's maybe a good idea to like reflect on on just like why am I doing this um which is certainly something I've done in the past as well yeah well maybe I mean you're somebody who has uh probably a pretty good information diet I would imagine you're you know pursuing your uh computer science degree at Yale uh maybe we could talk a little bit about going to Yale and what inspired you to go there because you know I know that you've got you probably got into lots of universities including a lot of engineering universities like Caltech um what inspired you specifically to go to kind of a stodgy old Northeastern liberal arts college instead of going to college yeah yeah I mean so I I chose to go to Yale over schools that are perhaps like better known for engineering or computer science programs on the West Coast Coast because I like also like really love a lot of the liberal arts classes like there's a there's a lot of like smaller things that added up to it um but I would say the big thing is I personally believe that a computer science curriculum is pretty standardized across all colleges yeah like it's the same data structures it's the same algorithms you're not learning like necessarily like a a novel you know binary tree or something if you choose to go to an engineering school to the same extent and a lot of the curriculum here is also like adapted from other schools and they like do acknowledge that as well often so it's a good enough CS program but it also has everything else that you get from attending a liberal art school and you know philosophy and emology and and different topics like that right computer science rankings if you go to like CS rankings. org. I don't remember which website it is but but there's like there's a lot of websites that like keep track of like CS rankings in the United States those are based on two things which are also kind of the same thing which is the amount of research that gets output by that University which has nothing to do with teaching field yes which is absolutely no like at least in my experience like research being a really good researcher does not mean you're a good professor um and so like a school like CMU for example is very high up on there because they just have number of insane number of Cs faculty it is objectively just an incred school to go to for computer science it's super rigorous it's a great program um but like I don't I think as an undergrad like for me at least having like the highest CS ranking wasn't the most important thing to me like I also spent a lot of time thinking about like the experience of of being a student there um and I'm not talking specifically about any one school here versus any one other school um and I think that's a personal decision that a lot of people have to make for themselves for me at least like I always thought I was going to go to an engineering school back in in high school and it was literally like I went to the pre-orientation days for for Yale and I met some awesome people and I realized like that that was just where I wanted to to spend the next four years um and so it wasn't n a it wasn't really about computer science I guess was my answer which I I I don't know if that's necessarily like a satisfying answer yeah but I mean that makes sense if if you look at like computer science curricula as like it meets a certain threshold of quality and then it doesn't have to be the absolute best I think people get preoccupied with optimizing for one dimension when really you want your little character Pentagon to like you know be more three-dimensional I guess uh I mean like I think it matters a lot more for like Master's programs grad school like certainly then I would spend a lot of time considering um okay like what is this and but then even then it's not really about the school it's about the specific Pi that you're doing research with um principal investigator like the main principal investigator okay I didn't even know that acronym okay it's it's like the the main person in a lab who it like that could be at any school and often it's schools that you like wouldn't necessar like a school like y or Harvard might not be the best school for a particular area of research um and so then it really is a lot more about like doing your research on what kind of um I guess research you want to be doing and then rankings I guess within computer science are more likely to correlate to like the school that you're going to do research on but that's not really something I spent a lot of time considering for undergrad if that makes sense um yeah so just to kind of recap what you just said like first of all CS programs are more similar than they are different generally if you're going to like a State University or if you're going to a good private university like Yale um and you can consider other things like the campus experience I mean uh you're getting to live on a you know 3004 year 100 year old campus I don't know how old Y is it's pretty old um it's more than three like yeah it was founded in I think 1701 so older than the US yeah yeah so so you're getting to like and they probably literally got ivy on some of the buildings it's part of the ivy league um so I can imagine that experience and also you're from the south like I am you're from uh Florida and getting to live up there in is is it in New England I'm I'm it's in yeah yeah I'm lying a lot of my ignorance about the Northeast I've never lived up there but um it's about like an hour and 50 minute train from New York city so yeah it's in Connecticut um I grew up in South Florida never lived in the northeast or anywhere there was snow or it got cold so this is a total shock to me as well did you have one of those experiences like oh my first time seeing snow do you remember that I did have a magical experience the first time it snowed here yeah it was um it doesn't snow that often unfortunately um with like other people are like yay and I'm like I want more snow um but that's just the like inner child in me I guess I I think that what I would say is I have never been like I've never been a student at a at a State University um so I can't compare like I've never been a student at other schools so I can't tell you that ex school I can't tell you they're exactly the same I can't tell you that they're similar I can just say based on like my perception of things I'm very happy with how all of this stuff sort of correlates I do know that I have friends at schools that are like like for example like at Stanford um where they do have like courses that yell doesn't offer in some areas like there there's definitely The Core Curriculum is very often very similar but then there's like elective classes that are really awesome if you go to a school that's a lot more focused on computer science for example um but you know there's pros and cons with everything so that would sort of be my breakdown of of computer science at at different universities and and I'll just say like a lot of people watching this are or listening to this uh are probably thinking like why are they talking about un like I I'm like in my 30s I'm in my 40s I don't care about universities move on to something interesting quy but I take university courses all the time uh like I I audited courses I'm a 43y old dude right like why am I doing this because I like learning and I think that it's like a huge Competitive Edge that so many other people are you know sedentary and like oh I'm just going to tune out and like watch Netflix or something and I'm sitting here learning as much as I can right uh anyone can benefit from the courses that yell is publishing online right and and like certainly I've I've taken a lot of Stanford courses uh computer science courses over the years because I just studied at a state school and I don't have a computer science degree I actually have a degree in English right because I was an English teacher so um just because we're talking about universities and and you may be past University age don't don't completely tune out of this section because there's a lot to be learned and a lot of the benefit of having all these great teachers in one place teaching courses and being able to publish them on the Internet like we can reap the benefits of that too even if we're in our 30s and 40s and and if you're somebody who's High School age and you're considering going to get a University degree um we've got the guy who created College compendium right here maybe you could give some advice to people who are like just some quick advice to people who are younger like you know maybe 16ish uh thinking about what they're going to do in the future whether they should go to university do you think people should still go to university I mean I'm biased because I I am currently a university um I think like there's a lot of factors that go into that decision um and like some of them are personal some of them are family some of them are Financial some of them are like what your goals are um to do long-term in life I think that going to University opens a lot of doors like having a University degree does help you get a job after the fact especially in computer science um but you don't necessarily like need to do that there's no like one path in life um yeah and you don't have you certainly don't have to go to any one school there's like this idea I think in in high school that like there's um like this this track Like they definitely push you in high school to apply to college as like sort of the next PATH um and like for a lot of people that is the right choice um and for some people it's not and that's like a personal choice you kind of have to make um but certainly what I would say is like it's worth it to learn computer science regardless of if you're doing either of those things like I think that a lot of the computer science that I learned I learned before coming to you um and it wasn't like in a high school classroom necessarily either it was through platforms like free code camp like solo learn um like learn being a mobile app that people use sometimes uh to supplement free Cod Camp I've talked with the founder uh yeah yeah there's a there's I mean there's literally a million amazing free resources to learn like literally anything you want to learn not just in computer science but like in any field um like available already on the web and so I think it it really just boils down to like what are you interested in learning about and then actually pursuing that like something that I I've learned recently is there's actually a Wikipedia app um mhm and this Wikipedia app will just show you information about all kinds of historical events that happened on like today like each day and it's just sort of like a simple random way too that you can just discover a lot more knowledge than you like previously had um and so like I think if you're a curious person there's a lot of resources like that that exist that are free and even if you're not that curious it's it's a supplement to your curiosity because I wouldn't necessarily think to learn about for example the Tower of knowledge I was in uh Pittsburgh and there's this University that built this they wanted to have like an educational skyscraper and it was so intriguing to me like what's the Tower of knowledge like I never would have thought that but I just happened to uh be reading like the Wikipedia article of for Pittsburgh and it just mentioned that and I was like oh what's that and I I like learned all about this fascinating structure uh the tallest educational building in the world basically built maybe like 30 or 40 years ago maybe 50 years ago uh but it's like so intriguing and you know this this information will just come to you if you keep your antennas out I'm hoping that at least some of the things that you're hearing just here on this podcast you know inspire you to go and learn more about topics one topic though that we do want to talk about absolutely is ethics and everybody's eyes are probably glazing over oh my goodness AI ethics and machine learning right like most computer science programs and we did like a a survey of the top you know 50 or so computer science program most computer science programs this was part of us essentially assembling the Freo Camp University degree program and figuring out what to teach to whom and uh Sam Sam cromby was also involved in this effort and huge thanks to him we're going to have him on the podcast in the near future as well but essentially ethics is completely under taught in my humble opinion it it it's it's almost kind of like a punchline a joke like oh business business ethics as as though there are any ethics and something is Cutthroat as business right or AI ethics as long as though computer scientists really care about that but actually a lot of people do care about uh AI ethics and there are a ton of ethical considerations and it's not just um thinking in terms of like what does it mean to be a good AI right A lot of it is there's real world risk because these these models are being deployed and and you just created this entire 2-hour course about it and uh unfortunately it was like one of your least popular course it's just because I think there's not a lot of interest in ethics but maybe you could use this moment to kind of like give people an idea of why ethics is important for programmers and Computer Sciences scientists especially when they're working with AI models I think I would frame the course as sort of everything you need to know to have like a conversation about AI like maybe like half the course is about ethics a lot of the course is also about just like what an neural network is and like how to talk about a lot of these philosophical questions that are really interesting about artificial intelligence and which like make for interesting conversations like the black and white room experiment or um the Chinese room experiment is another famous One um the ethical questions are also there and also important and I think the reason they're important is because of the just sheer impact that these tools that we're building have um like we have what's really amazing about computer science like in my in my opinion the thing that I think is the the coolest about learning to code is the fact that you can like make a website or make an app or make some application something with code that it impacts literally every person in the world who has internet or like who has access to that yeah you can push free C Camp and anybody can open any device that has a browser and they can go there and they can consume that instantly and that's just insane like that is amazing and something that like is by far to me the coolest thing about like any of of programming or the Internet is just the sheer level of impact you're able to have like if I taught the same I did teach this class this AI ethics and machine learning course that I taught um for free free code Camp I taught it to a small group of like 20 high school students um before that and I spent a lot of time teaching them this course and I'm sure like it was really cool to have that experience of teaching this like in person um but maximum 20 people can ever experience that versus like theoretically anyone who wants to you the viewer can watch this video course if you're interested and that's really special to me um but what it also means is that whatever you say in that course whatever um you put in that website or application or how it's designed even if you're like not really thinking about it or it's accidental or it's incidental um can have a really big impact cuz there's like a a butterfly effect um for really small things that that are like really really dangerous at scale that's why like programming and and design of good programming it's really important to think about for example like when you're taking a class on data structures that things run in like you know o of one or o of nend time like you want your time complexity to be low not because it really matters when things are small but because it really matters when things are big and you can apply that same idea or principle to AI applications and deploying them in real world environments like if you're building a self-driving car yes we should definitely talk about this because Cruz has been in the news and apologies to anybody who works at cruise but like that company was a total disaster based on what I've read about it like I've never seen uh well that that's hyperbole I I've seen very few companies that are so flippant with safety uh I mean it's amazing but uh just to give you some context uh I heard uh that in this report that was conducted and one of the reasons Cruz is no longer in operation it may not ever be in operation again uh I did not know that yeah really they took all the cars off the road after billions and billions of dollars in investment in San Francisco right yeah yeah so what happened was um uh a woman was like bumped by a car hit by a car whatever she flew over into the path of the crew Cruise car and the cruise car basically dragged her for like 20 or 30 ft while it was trying to pull over cuz that was what his programming was is like oh there's been an accident I need to pull over so he's dragging this woman who's in critical condition now I think she did live but you could imagine how like some decision like oh if there's an accident just pull over there's no consideration for like what if somebody's like right in front of the car or like you know how how can you be sure I'm I think that they probably had sensors in place to know whe whether somebody was being dragged like huh that's weird we're like driving really slow or the is the parking break engaged or something I don't know but um it came out that like their AI system had difficulty identifying small children and yet they were in production like the cars were on the road so you can imagine like if they hadn't been pulled lots of kids might have gotten hit by these cars I mean like they weren't just on the Road Quincy I rode in one like the last time I was in San Francisco I've been in self-driving Cruise like literally like God in one I'm sitting in the back there's like a panel in between you and the wheel and it's just going on its own yeah that was a pretty crazy experience it was actually it was really funny cuz we were trying to go from one like location to a location that was maybe like five blocks away and it did the most circuitous route it possibly could have like I think it was like a 40-minute ride for like something that could have been like a 10-minute ride um but I think it's maybe sometimes you look at Google Maps and you're like why is it taking me all the way over there well it's just the software is not perfect right a human Taxi Driver would be like a lot of yeah SF has a lot of really like difficult roads that I think they just try to avoid in general so that is my assumption for why it don't ever drive the street yeah they really wind you one um so all that to say like I I definitely think I like is a very obvious example of how like an autonomous vehicle um which granted is a really difficult thing to program um like I like yes like it you know obviously that's a really bad situation um that they they should have been pulled for for but it's also like it's it's a very difficult thing to build a self-driving car absolutely 100% that is perfect right out of the gate G and I guess like the the the thing of AI safety AI ethics um it is important because it doesn't matter as much when they're really really small numbers of those cars on the road just in like one city right yeah but when you scale it like like time complexity scale it up you have millions of people taking rides it starts to get a lot more dangerous and even though like in theory self-driving cars could already be safer than human drivers there's all of these like complex questions about accountability like who's responsible when things go wrong like if it's a human driver we know who's in the wrong always like it's one of the drivers for the most part um but when there's a self-driving car involved it adds all of this extra complexity that we haven't really figured out yet to my knowledge like how that's going to work um and so there there's like a lot still left I guess yeah there's a lot of real world encroaching on this beautiful engineering problem isn't there yeah I mean because the real world is complicated and like in a perfect world autonomous vehicles could probably be ready to like drive like today yeah the the difficulty is human drivers and human pedestrians are like really difficult to predict like some guy might just fall asleep and swerve into the the car or like some pedestrian might decide they're going to make a a run for it across the street even though the cars are going and it's a red light for them because that's what humans do and it's really difficult for cars to predict all of those possible outcomes and then also make the choice that like saves the most number of people or like or or protects the do you protect the person in the car at all costs do you protect the most number of people there's all kinds of interesting questions as well within that like that can be thought about I think interesting ways and I actually don't think the trolley problem is that interesting of a question here yeah I I don't either but I do some of these things uh you you have to choose whether you want to just leave the switch alone in which case this train is going to go and kill five people or if you want to hit the switch in which case this train is going to dout and it's going to go kill one person but when you do that when you hit that switch technically you're sentencing that person to death right whereas in action you can kind of like oh it wouldn't me but so it's kind of like a philosophical question but one thing that I loved about the web comic is how people imagine it and it's them standing at the switch trying to decide what to do and how it actually is going to be when when like things are deployed at scale and you've got all these systems making these decisions is you're one of the people on the track and somebody else is making the decision or some AI engineer has already kind of made the decision in the code as to what is supposed to happen in this situation and you're the one who's going to die for their decision that's one of the reasons that ethics is so important is because we want to make sure software Engineers who are designing these systems like self-driving cars care about it and think about think things through and have a framework for you know dealing with the messy reality the complexity of reality yeah and I mean like these things are also like not everything is life and death but since we're on the topic of life and death like one of the to elaborate on my my major one of the and why I came to Yo actually yo is one of the the best schools in the world for spefic specifically politics and like geopolitics International politics um and my my four major is computer science and Global Affairs so I did some work I do do some work in the intersection of those things um and like over the last year I've done some work in like AI policy area and I had the opportunity to learn a lot about a lot of the things that people consider like existential risk like what are like some of the really dangerous things that exist with with an AI that you actually should be scared about as someone who lives in a free democracy um whether that's you know potential micr targeting that could influence elections in the next like 6 to 12 months or even something like a a bioweapon that is like a another Co that could be easily created by some of these models yeah AI is speeding up drug Discovery but it's also speeding up discovery of other things that you don't necessarily want to discover ex exactly like there's like sort of a like it's such a powerful tool and like all tools it's you know like a hammer you can use it for good or you can use it for evil and we have to like do our best to make sure that these tools are deployed in ways that are like ethically responsible and like don't harm the human race like as much as possible um and not everything is like about like the singularity like this idea like oh no get all the headlines I mean a lot of people but you and I I don't think we've ever talked about the singularity in our many conversations I think we have I don't think we've ever talked about Skynet taking over the world and killing everybody uh not everything is movies like I think the the the real world ways in which AI is applied are much are very are also really important and less discussed um for example in hiring and in um recruiting like I is examining resumés it's like a first pass now in a lot of places um and there's a lot of studies for example there was a study that that Amazon had where like they're they were using AI in their recruiting process and it was in some way discriminating against different groups of people without like people really even realizing it because the problem with AI systems in general and this is like a problem that you can really boil down almost all of ai's problems into um from an eth eal question is that they're black boxes which is to say we really don't understand in a lot of cases why they make the decisions they do yeah um and we also don't therefore have a way to like just we we can't argue with an AI when it makes a decision if we don't know why you can't even ask it why it made the decision it did and it might just lie understand decision he made it might just come up with some kind of like postao like story to like oh oh I gave you this recommendation because what can I say here that'll sound plausible you know well it's like when you use Chachi BT right to do math it's actually pretty good at doing math now or writing code but that's because it's like also like calling a specific function to like run MTH problems and code that part of it versus just doing it using what it was originally doing when you first launched chat gbt which was just like the same sort of text generation it was always doing um and that's because there was like a lack of understanding of what the math actually represented like you can think of these AI models specifically within the large language model context as like really really really really good autocomplete and it's really good like almost like it's magical almost um until it isn't and the more you use it the more you realize that there's sometimes like a lack of understanding that's really critical um and that problem is getting resolved in multiple different ways like it's way more accurate now than it was when it originally launched yeah um but it's also something where you can liken it there's a really great article that was written by the author of this book um claraa and the sun I think or maybe it the son maybe it was the over story I'm not 100% sure which which author wrote it um I had give me the link to that and I'll add that to the the video description SL podcast show notes yeah it was about how chap PT is kind of a blurry jpeg of the internet yes I read that I read that that's a really you read that you read this article yeah great article um because it's also supered lossy yeah it's a loss it's not a lossless um program and so what you're seeing when it Auto completes is kind of like it trying to like recreate the space between um and sometimes it does that well and sometimes it doesn't and that is also what's happening in a lot of these cases with AI models making making decisions where we are trying to like understand how they're coming to those conclusions and and we don't always understand that um and so like when it comes to AI policy AI ethics AI safety it covers so many different things right from Deep fakes to disinformation to um you know this like existential risk of bioweapon to or just more mundane stuff like really empowering scammers like AI can just you can scam at scale now in a way that you could never do if you had like a call center of scammers uh Opera it's really good at writing spam it's really good at helping people like cheat on their plagiarize yeah um because it's hard to detect and they ways of circumventing the AI detection algorithms that exist and AI is very bad at detecting AI any AI if you're a school if you're like a you know a Chief Information officer at like a university and somebody's trying to sell you AI detection AI plagiarism detection software run the other way that stuff does not work everybody I talk to says it's basically a crapshoot and it's just a cash grab like because I wouldn't describe it as a cash grab but I would describe it as a cat game where like each of them are like constantly getting better at fighting the other thing in the same way that like a vaccine or like a medicine um over time the pathogens learn to resist the medicine and you have to come up with a new I that may be the case but in the case of gbt 4 they people ran a bunch of uh like a bunch of academics ran a bunch of tests on gp4 and said like hey was this content generated by gp4 and even the most powerful llm ever created could not reliably detect AI generated text so it makes depends on how deep you want to get into that but there's like a couple things they're using to actually detect that um yeah let's go deeper into that because I'm very interested in that as a teacher uh and somebody who talks with teachers all the time and tries to you don't want to have false positives where you're blaming your students for plagiarizing when they didn't it's much better you know I was it Ben Franklin that said I'd rather like 99 men go free than innoc guilty men go free than one innocent man you know face execution or something like that right like you want to air on the side of caution and you don't want to like because it's incredibly demoralizing and disruptive to people when they're taking like some sort of exam and like you've been flagged as a cheater by this AI or um people submitted an essay and their teachers like yeah it looks like it was plagiarized but you didn't plagiarize can you imagine how mading that would be you worked your butt off to like create this you know uh term paper and some algorithm written by some you know edtech company education technology company is like oh we we feel 95% confidence interval that you cheated and like now your ecademic record is Tainted just because somebody did a bad job of coding software uh yeah I mean uh maybe you can talk about the state of plagiarism detection yeah I mean so I think you're right like all of this is really boils down to um type one and type two error which is if you're not familiar with Statistics false positives and false negatives right um and actually that's not just the issue at hand for plagiarism detection that's the issue at hand for all AI stuff like all of the these questions of like for example like do you want more of um like what are you trying to select for what is worse like would you rather have someone not get hired because the AI is screwed up or would you rather have the AI like select for this thing over some other situation um there there's like a lot of complexity that exists when you're trying to deal with systems that are really really really um black boxy like yeah um yeah I mean there's no this is the fundamental problem in AI of interpretability like how did the AI come to this conclusion and because it's an inscrutable neural network we don't well people are working on this this is something that's getting a lot better already like this is because it is such a big important thing that a lot of research is currently going into interpretability and it is something that does exist for some models so it's not correct to say that like no AI is understandable AI systems that we can understand yeah that was hyperbole so so real quick we have a course called No blackbox AI uh taught by Radu Dr rodu computer science Professor uh from uh I think Finland uh don't don't blame me ru if I can't remember exactly where you're from but uh he uh basically teaches you how to build an AI where you can understand what's going on but my understanding of the state-ofthe-art is inscrutable systems blackbox systems and you know um AI that we can actually understand how it's making decisions interpretable interpretable uh AI systems are so far behind and most people are just going to go with the most powerful option they're going to they're going to go with uh you know gp4 instead of some other system where they can necessarily tease out exactly what's done and in some cases you will want a system where you can do that but there's always going to be the temptation to grab the much more powerful tool that's harder to understand and just for context the YouTube recommendation engine that you know recommends free Camp videos to people we don't know how it works and we've talked with Engineers from YouTube and they don't necessarily know how it works either they're like why does it's really good though yeah it works great but I mean it always that's exactly what I wanted to watch yeah um so I mean if you I worked on to to elaborate on what I meant before um I took an NLP class yeah natural Lang processing um and for my like final project in that class I tried to do some some research and work on making AI like chat GPT generated text undetectable by a lot of the biggest AI detection software like um I think like originality AI is one of them um turnit in.com is another gbd predates AI stuff they they they've long been in that industry of like cheating which again I'm a skeptic of if you haven't if you can't guess I'm very critical of that industry and I think it redu it produces a lot of false positives uh people who are well- meaning who did not cheat who suffer consequences because they were incorrectly labeled as a cheater well my my goal here was to see if it was possible to do that and also then like how that sort of worked um so basically there's two things that AI detection software typically looks at yes um the two like areas one of them is called perplexity like a perplexity score yeah maybe what that is it's like how well language models can like predict um the word sequences that an AI model will generate because like they're they are derivative and therefore like like when we talk about like uniqueness we kind of glossed over this earlier about you were saying like you know is there anything truly unique well it's hard to say but it is true that with AI models like you're able to end up with the same output if you give it the same exact input and and other like very specific details so might be like slightly different word but the general thrust is similar unless you crank up the temperature yes but like I guess what I'm saying is an AI model like I I sort of said before chat GPT is just really really really really good auto complete m M theoretically what what it's doing literally all of the time is just trying to predict the best next word based on the previous input sequence of words yes and so in theory you could do sort of a reverse of that and figure out like okay what was the most probable sequence of words and then if that matches what the student inputed then there's a high chance that they used AI for that that's one thing the other um like thing that they measure is called burstiness burstiness like burstiness to burst to explode kind of burstiness kind of it basically means like like repetition of repetition of phrases but also like when when a human writes we don't write sentences of equal length or like of of us like we usually write some short sentences followed by some longer runon sentences followed by short like humans don't write perfect sentences okay um perfect paragraphs a do burst a burst of Fire from a you know automatic weapon sorry to to use that analogy but that's what I think of when I think of a burst in terms of it's kind of like uh it's like a similarity score yeah it's like a similarity score between like sections or between like different pieces and so those two things combined or how like something like gbd Z Would detect to my understanding to be clear like I didn't work on their tools so I not 100% sure but I I sort of look at that as two like statistics that people use to me um How likely it is that the text is AI generated and the challenge here is as you said before AI is just getting better and better and gbd4 writes text that's way more realistic than any of the previous versions of and and also like we have open source models now like llama like mistol um that are getting better and better that will like eventually I think we're going to see sort of a like model parody or almost like a like there will be a baseline level of quality ac across these models very high computer science programs that us universities yeah one of the challenges humans are humans are not that good at English also like a lot of us like I write sentences with bad grammar all the time like and I'm a college student um if you're like trying to detect plagiarism in like an elementary or middle or High School setting like the average middle schooler probably isn't writing like great essays and so it's going to be really hard to tell um in a lot of those cases like is that actually something they wrote because even if they make like a couple tweaks it it it almost asks the question like do we need to change the way in which WR like writing this tool that has been around forever is that still the best system for like like what is the purpose of writing yeah it's to sort of help you like check that you understand what you're talking about and so the CH the problem is that like if you use AI to write your essay for you that doesn't actually prove that you understand the thing like the process of writing is a process of revision and editing and it has the same outcome which is you turn in this paper but it do I mean the actual deliverable is a piece of paper with words on it even though the process that I go through as somebody who's not cheating is read a bunch of Articles synthesize that into an outline synes SP that outline into anart whereas you know a person who's cheating would be like hey I need to write a term paper on XYZ write me a 500 word you know 10,000 say on this if you want to hear a fun story about AI plagiarism and then we can move on from this top yeah I mean I could talk about this all day but I don't know about the audience if they really care that much about it so I one of the things I I learned when I was working on on some of this last year um was have you heard of Unicode lookalikes Unicode lookalikes yes yes so Unicode characters uh there are thousands of them every Chinese character every uh Arabic letter every English character and then like emojis stuff like that and sometimes you'll find characters that look very similar that uh like is that period actually a period or what language period is that because like Japanese periods look different than English periods and stuff like that so characters that look very similar to the human eye but actually have different Unicode values is that correct that's exactly it and what's really interesting what's really interesting is this has been fixed at this point because they realized that this was a huge vulnerability these these plagarism detection softwares but something you used to be able to do was you could just write something in Chachi BT and then contrl f for like every instance of the letter e or the letter A or something and then replace it with a Unicode lookalike of the letter e or the letter a and it would like completely make it like the burstiness perplexity scores would just explode because in in terms of um like how unlikely it is that it was AI generated because AI doesn't generate text with Unicode lookalikes that's like such a unique character cuz they're not trained on text with that stuff and like AI is not actually looking at like the letter it's looking at like the machine representation of the letter right so um that in itself I guess like yeah and AI would never swap out the you know e for like some you know IPA like International Phonetic alphabit equivalent e or something like that that looks the same a human probably wouldn't do that either and so they figured that out and that was like that was like an exploit uh that was an vulnerability it was exploited that was probably closed hopefully by the AI detection industrial complex uh and uh as a result people are having to move on to different attacks just like any sort of security vulnerability would be patched like there you know Apple discovered that do XYZ to crack a phone and suddenly you know they've got a fix for it in the next release Auto downloaded and we move on and people keep trying to discover these you got all these security researchers so it's a similar kind of arms race to what we have yeah with any other security consideration I mean so like still in the vein of like talking about AI use cases within you know an education system but not necessarily in the same context of plagiarism I suppose it could be be viewed as that is that like AI also writes really good code really really good code um in a lot of cases it's really good at debugging your code it's really good at figuring out like what exactly is going wrong in a memory leak it's really good at understanding error messages um and there's all kinds of new tools that exist now because of that like GitHub co-pilot and cursor if you've used cursor I've heard good things about it yeah there's a lot of even vs code has Integrations now for that so if you're like a developer chances are you've seen this stuff or you've used this stuff and you also can use AI to write a lot of your code like there's a lot of code that exists that's boilerplate there's a lot of code that exists that is like writing a react function or something like a a hook like this is something that you do a lot it's replicable there's a lot of training data for it um and so it like begs these questions of how should this be used in in production settings and how can it like improve our workflows um and I'm actually very optimistic and positive about this because I think it's going to do I'm not worried about AI necessarily replacing a programmer um anytime soon because of complexity across like entire projects like AI is very good at writing one file two files three files um it's not yet capable at least I haven't seen it be capable of like writing an entire full stack project from scratch like maybe extremely simple proof of concept type applications yes like like maybe something simple a simple game that people have made a million tutorials for maybe a website it's not going to be able to build some crazy like full stack application um by itself in one go without someone who actually understands coding can connect the dots and so the way that I see this sort of playing out at least for me in my use of this has been use it to write like a function or two or help me understand what's going wrong within the code so it you can be like a 10x developer in terms of the speed of your your code output but you still have to have like this sort of higher level understanding of how you're connecting all of these pieces so that you build like software that compiles and runs when you're talking about these really large projects with like 50 plus files because like speaking honestly like that's most big projects if you're working at a big organization or a big company or a big personal project or startup like it's likely your code base isn't that simple and especially if a couple different developers have touched it in anytime has passed codebases get very large uh I mean build the context window of llm is pretty small even then like the more you give it the more confused it'll get by stuff it could be many years and many uh kind of like engineering breakthroughs before you could feed a large Legacy codebase into um into well people are working on this yeah I mean it's an active area study but we'll see it's very much a Never Say Never situation um I think like I've seen already some people have built really cool tools that you're able to like give a GitHub repository to and it like reads through the whole GitHub repository and figures out opening issues right and it's able to like explain your code base open issues like these are like really cool use cases um but there's a difference between being able to like understand a code base and being able to like write the whole code base from scratch and I don't I don't know I mean like I think we'll see improvements over time and that's when the really exciting things about this field and this this area not to spend so much time talking about it yeah well whenever new tools come out developers should learn them so I mean this is fairly meta but for this week um maybe not as much meta is Apple but what do you think of the New Vision Pro and like what spatial Computing means for Education like when I see this I I Envision like a couple years down the line or sooner being able to interact with like physical manifestations of like a binary tree or a hash table or like computer chip like abrac things that are like ideas in a textbook and bring them into the realm of like something you can you can see and potentially even touch um I think it's really exciting for a lot of kind of mechanical engineering things for sure maybe for some semiconductor engineering uh but it may also be a helpful tool for understanding you know abstract software Concepts like data structures algorithms like seeing how the data Cascades through a particular application like you know we see all these different Renditions of programming in the future uh I think the show Westworld had one that was pretty cool with like the tablets and of course yes uh the computer interfaces from Minority Report where you have to stand there and move your hands around all day and like you have to be incredibly fit just to use a computer and the world of uh Minority Report but I mean I've always been like very excited about these just from a wow perspective you know like watching you know Iron Man and seeing all the different interface you strap something onto your head and it's essentially like augmented reality and so you can put whatever you want in physical space Microsoft has done this for quite a while with the hollow lens I'm sure there are some good industrial applications uh I will be amazed if it really makes that big of a difference over just looking at a 2d screen like I can represent a lot of stuff really well in 2D on a flat rectangle thing that I'm looking at and it's true good yeah absolutely and you know as Sergey Bren observed if you hold the the screen like a screen that's like this far from your face might as well be an iMac screen you know in terms of like how you're looking at it well that's Pro kind of is right like I think for me like like obviously like VR has existed for like a decade now and you could already do these things where you like move around with objects and virtual reality like using the meta Quest or Oculus um but what's interesting about the app this new Apple device to me is that it's like the best example of um like not really AR cuz you're still looking at screens reality reality it feels it feels like you're still able to see your surroundings so you're not like in this enclosed view you like can kind of see things like in your real life I don't know if this is necessarily like it is still like very early very expensive but um maybe there is a world where that's something that people use for more than just entertainment um yeah I don't know I I think a lot of it comes down to like cost like yeah if you're a wealthy person and you want to have a a system on a chip like laid out in front of you so you can like look at all the different you know components of you know a processor um yeah that's great but until there's like a huge install base of people who can afford to do that who's going to write the software for it right that was like the Google Glass kind of chicken in the egg problem nobody was really that interested in Google Glass and Google was working very hard to try to get people to develop for Google Glass but I knew a lot of people in San Francisco Silicon Valley during the time that Google Glass was like Rising before they kind of abandoned the project uh and I don't think anybody really built apps for it because the install base was so small so you have to get like a big enough install base for people to start really building meaningful apps but like assuming that they can solve that business case problem and that there are really cool you know experiences that you can put in there I have yet to see like a killer app for VR like my understanding is is there something about the way the brain works and the ears work and stuff like you can't really move around in VR without feeling a little sick so almost all the you know VR type games have been like experiences where you have a fixed point of view or you're like sitting somewhere and you're able to look around or you're on like a you know a roller coaster or something like that because that's not going to make sick well you're also fundamentally like wearing a ski mask right like it's it's difficult to move around with that weight on your head without you know recognizing that you have that weight on your head um I do think there's a couple crucial differences with the Vision Pro because it's Apple that solves some of those problems um one of which is it's Apple's ecosystem already so all of your photos all of these applications that are on the app store by default are like also on the Vision Pro as 2D screens and that's not exactly building for the Vision Pro but it it solves a lot of the utility issues that I think other like devices that are starting from scratch have um the other one the backward compatibility by the way video game industry backward compatibility has also always been like a huge deal PlayStation 3 can play PlayStation 2 games yeah well I actually think that's one of the challenges that Apple faces is Apple's never really been a gaming company and or a company that like people go to for games and that's one of the main applications of V up until now like Mata has a huge advantage over them on that specifically but you can also just like mirror Dem Mo your PS4 or Xbox to it if you really wanted to if that's something you want to do yeah and to me at least the big difference here is this being Apple I find it unlikely they're going to have and if I think I think they'll put a lot of money into it I think years of R&D are ahead like the iPhone wasn't a perfect product as like the first iteration of it it didn't even have an app store as the first generation of it but like by the time the iPhone 5 or the iPhone 6 rolled around it was like a mass Market product that like basically is the same iPhone that exists today with like some minor changes yeah um and that's like one of the best products ever made and so to me what I'm really excited about is not this really expensive Tech demo that exists today yeah but where's where's heading where is this going to be in five years that's I'm I'm really excited to try that and like I I think that the people who are excited about the Vision Pro today are like really excited about that future too um and you're sort of like thinking about spatial Computing not to go back to contextual Computing but like I think to me one of the coolest things I can imagine is like I I'm wearing context right now right but I I I have glasses I almost always wear glasses when I'm like in classes and stuff um what if my glasses just also like had a screen to the side that was able to show me information about what I'm looking at or who I'm talking to or what I said the last time I talked to this person or when their birthday is or is keeping notes during class or is up relevant information just putting a clock up there would be pretty awesome right like never needing to know what time or which direction am I facing am I facing a clock the weather Direction like there's so much information that like having a HUD um or an HUD like around yourplay yeah yeah um could be really valuable and like so I have a I I know someone at Yale um who's working on these like glasses that are glasses that basically make captions it's like subtitles for your life um and he's working with the Stanford kid to do this um and to me that's like a very early application of what like the long-term potential of this is yeah um which is to like be able to like have all of this additional information I mean well you mention subtitles for your life like literally subtitling I don't want like some simultaneous translation app like telling me what somebody's saying and in my ear I I'd love to just read subtitles when I'm talking to somebody in a language I don't understand or something you know what I'm saying like think of what a game that would be so helpful for me yeah yeah so that's all very interesting um where this is possible to go I'm glad that our yeah I mean I think there's tons of like obvious utility if you can get it to work in the form factor of like a pair of glasses even pack you get the all that stuff I think they'll get there little weird mask yeah I don't want to wear a weird ski mask and I also I want to actually be able to see things and not rely on the software like I'm never going to feel comfortable like driving or something if that could like short out and like suddenly I'm completely blinded or something like that cuz the past revision is actually like they render what the cameras are seeing it's still a screen yeah it's not a past through screen and and to me I'm a lot more interested in AR than I am in augmented reality virtual real I think for the Practical reasons of AR is like informational VR is like experiential like I I do play games uh like I'm I'm a big fan of like Doom Eternal and like the the really deep gameplay of that that came out a few years ago and when I'm playing the game it does not matter what like how big the screen is or anything like I'm I'm in trance there was this great uh documentary about the history of like industrial design that I watched a long time ago I can't remember the name of it it's I think it's by the same guy that did the helvetica um documentary if you haven't seen that that's a really good one but basically they had this like you know German engineer who's talking about like I built the perfect laptop look you can do this got all these different designed factors and stuff and he he gets this made and then he he gets a prototype and he sits down and he's using it and he realized very quickly like once you start actually using a computer all that other stuff just melts away and you're just focused on the task at hand you don't need like you know 4K you know giant screen like you don't need like a lot of the usability interface like you go back and you play an old arcade game from 40 years ago and it's just a joy stick and buttons and you can kind of mesh with that game just as well as you can with you know a modern game where you're using like a keyboard and the mouse or something like that right like it's really amazing how the human brain works how we're so able to tune in and tune out all the noise and really just focus on things so to some extent I do almost feel like using like VR headset is an over Overkill really like do I really need that is it really that much more immersive than what's already going on inside my brain yeah so I've always kind of been skep I I don't have one so yeah I can't really speak to that um yeah and in terms of like yeah there's an argument that reading a book your mind is doing all this stuff and it can be almost as a Mir of experience reading a book as it could be having like some VR you know educational experience now some people might argue that like they're completely different and the use case is completely different but uh it it really just depends on how into reading you get and how powerful your mind is at bringing up these representations and stuff like that um yeah yeah I mean I don't mind I don't want to sound like a lite or anything but like books are great and books are going to exist as long as Humanity exists maybe not paper books I don't think there's really like a strong argument other than like Nostalgia for having a physical paper book you can have like a nice backl screen sorry I I know like half the people in the audience are probably like ah what the heck quizy I love K are great yeah love Kindles yeah yeah but but like the notion of text as an interface for your human brain it just carries so much information you know people say like uh a picture's worth a th words well depends on the words depends on the picture you know like a few words like uh Ernest Hemingway wrote like flash fiction he had like this six-word story which I'm going to tell you right now for sale baby shoes never worn just those six words like conveys like an entire kind of like mood and I mean like it'd be hard to capture that in a picture in the exact same way is that you know the six-word story captures so like six words six words are worth a thousand pictures I mean it just dep if you if you think of this video I mean this video is probably tens of thousands of pictures right it's 30 frames per second our words matter a lot more than like the picture of me in this room with exactly like if you just showed the picture outside of context you'd be like okay it's quzy it's some other guy uh who yeah the audio matters a lot more right um yeah like there's so much more to like education and I feel like the education industry if you want to call it that like because it is industrialized much to my chrin is around chasing these things like oh if we could get everybody a hollow lens or you know we we could completely change the world got everybody a Smartboard or we got every kid like their own laptop or something like that and that's not necessarily like there's a lot of technological solutionism in education and I'm much more of a back to- Basics kind of person like I I obviously I see the value in video see the value in multimedia and stuff like that not just reading textbooks but I also see the value in going up to a whiteboard with somebody and sketching out you know things and and learning from them in that way too uh so the old ways are not necessarily you know abandoned you can just expand your repertoire but I would absolutely say that like in my my opinion most education should probably be textual because it's just an extremely efficient way of communicating things and you know like I I kind of look at I'm an old man yelling at a cloud right uh like Tik Tok and like watching a 60c video that's trying to compress all this information into you get into a a loop of information grazing where you you're getting like really superficial topical kind of information but you're not really going very deep at all so that that is one thing where like I value the fact that people put out these lengthy podcasts like I listen to tons of podcasts that are several hours long uh I I watch tons of video essays on YouTube that are like three or four hours long right and I learn so much more from those than I probably would have learned from watching you know however many Tik toks that would be like 200 Tik toks about the same topic right uh just because there's going to be so much repetition yeah I mean people covering the same thing over and over um there's a really great article sort of a or like essay along the lines of what you were talking about with text um it's called text is the universal API um text is the universal API by Charles Dickens yeah um but very much like sort of speaking to the same thing that you were talking about this idea that like it always has been and all like will be the main way in which we like language is so important in how we understand our world um and convey information it's just so efficient it's so effective um yeah and I mean one of the reasons AI is so good at generating images is because it uses text to like reason about how to generate images like if you look at a lot of the new tools like dolly or uh what's the one that uh there there are several ones uh what's the one that you use Discord to talk with um for some reason it's escaping my memory the really popular one that people use to create all theour mid Journey mid Journey yes it's mid journey I think yeah yeah um I mean for me like the most mind-blowing thing the the first mind-blowing thing that I saw with like all of this AI was um NLP techniques of just like creating vector vector space um of words you would just embed like 10,000 of the most common English words and then you could do arithmetic on those words to do like King minus man plus woman equals Queen yeah and that like you could represent words and like their relationships Through Math that was just incredible to me and that you can do that with all kinds of different words and that you can do that then with um Finance the transducers and and you can um eventually like get to something gpt2 which was really the first time I saw something like a generative pre-train Transformer model um and it was just like absolutely mindblowing like very very early version of these AI image generators that could do like a 32x32 image um and immediately you're like look this is going to be revolutionary um and that is something I was lucky to be exposed to early through doing research but it's also just a um I don't know like I I think it's going to continue to improve over the the coming years yeah it remains to be seen whether we're going to get giant step changes like we get with you know GPT morla like is it is it going to be morla um or faster who knows um it's too early to say right yeah so I I just uh and you know we we've talked a lot about AI ethics and stuff like that one of the reasons I don't really care to think that much about you know whether we're going to build Skynet is because I'm not convinced that the growth rate is like that right now I don't think we need to worry that much about it I'm not saying you shouldn't worry about that but I don't think that that's the most immediate concern the more immediate concerns are misinformation scams and stuff like that I mean so I agree with that I think the argument that people will make is that it's not a like linear thing or even an exponential but that like there's just some kind of breakthrough that hasn't happened yet that's sort of like we have no idea when that breakthrough is going to happen it could be several consecutive breakthroughs that need to happen but they could happen quickly or they could and who knows like I like if you talk to the best AI researchers in the world like the timeline is all over the place between them so that's for me like why like I'm not an expert on this this is not something that I should be like my opinion doesn't matter very much um and therefore like I I just try to like stay out of those conversations for now one thing that you do have probably a very nuanced opinion on is physical activity as a programmer I I I know that uh at Yale you're a captain on the running team and I can only imagine how good you have to be at running and how into running you have to be to like pull that off but uh maybe you could talk a little bit about running and the role that it plays in your life yeah so importantly I'm a captain on the club running team not the okay Verity running team um they are incredibly talented Runners on like the official team um we do it for fun um but it's a I ran Varsity in high school and then um continued at Yale it's a great group of people to to run with um and I think like what's really interesting to me within the context of our conversation which is focused obviously on audience of mostly programmers or developers um is that there seems to me to be like this huge overlap between people in this ecosystem and running just so many software Engineers I know also like that's their like chosen sport or like mechanism for exercise along with maybe like some lifting or something but um and I have to be very candid that I used to run a lot when I was first learning to code and recently I switched to kind of like what I call Mall walking just because it's like lower impact and it's a little easier for me to like digest a podcast when I'm not hearing thp Thump Thump Thump you know uh it's just a little bit more mellow and you still get a lot of cardiovascular benefit just from walking quickly uh but um but yes I also was a programmer who ran a lot and so it's not lost on me that I know a lot of other programmers who run a lot too and have are very passionate about that type of activity well I guess the thing that I'm interested in asking you about or or talking with you about is what you think it is about running that is just like something that meshes well with yeah people who like to program to to do software engineering um because I have some thoughts on it I think yeah I mean I'll throw out some naive guesses uh it is a way to decompress and it's something that you kind of do automatically like once you start running you don't really have to think about it too much you just keep going and it gives you a lot of time and space to like maybe think about engineering problems you're facing or think about what you want to do next with a given project I mean that's exactly what I do too um I think like there's like definitely the element of it's just something you can do that's like good exercise while also letting your mind sort of like roam free um um and you can either think about what you're working on or you can sort of let yourself have some time to decompress distress um but it's also about I think to me this idea of like like I think a runner's higher like a there's almost like a flow State you enter into when you're running longdistance running because I I do specifically longdistance running um that you just sort of like get into it and it's a very similar feeling I think to the feeling you have when you sit down to like do a like pretty like intense programming session um of like really being sort of zoned into exactly what it is that you're doing right then um to me those are actually very similar things I I was curious if you felt um the same way definitely like I there's this old saying that like there's this old joke that you know what's the purpose of a program body is is is to keep their brain off the ground right like that's how so many programmers and developers and I guess you could say knowledge workers by extension have treated their body let's go eat some fast food we got to we got to get some sleep real quick everything is kind of like it's you're you're almost like paying lip service to the fact that you have a corporeal form that has to be maintained and uh I think that's to people's detriment if they neglect their their health um and running is something that really you know boosts your cardiovascular your respiratory Health um probably has all kinds of other positive knock on effects because historically like you know ancient humans probably ran a lot a lot more than they do to today you know whe whether that's running toward prey or running from predators um and there's there's something that does feel really good you get get all these endorphins when you run so it it maybe it just boosts your energy level it boosts your ability to to think I mean like I said I I feel like I get a lot of these just from walking and again I'm a 43y old man who uh has a lot of like weight just from like working out for years and years like it is kind of hard on your knees if you go running and it's hard on your lower leg too uh so people who are listening to this I know and people who have mobility issues and stuff like I wouldn't say like oh just throw to the as side and go run but I would say any physical activity you can engage in is probably going to be a virtuous circle in terms of improving your productivity improving your ability to think improving your your ability to sleep improving your energy level like all these things uh your body is a machine and you want to make sure that that machine gets regularly used and doesn't just becomes this thing that you kind of like spite there were so many years of my life when I was a kid where I was just like man I wish I was just like the lawnmower man I wish I could just be everywhere and do everything and like not have to think about like oh you know uh what am I going to eat for breakfast or oh man it's it's late I need to get some sleep you know like I didn't want to have those uh limitations I wanted to live in a realm of pure abstraction and have that kind of power of being a disembodied you know entity right probably tale is old as time I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote about this in Greek myth ol or something somebody giving up their body to become this omnipresent spirit that can do whatever right um but the reality is you have a heart you have lungs you have a brain you have all these other things in your body and you need to to keep those sharp if you want to be able to perform and you know I'm optimizing for longevity I want to live to be 100 years old I don't think there's any reason uh unless you have like genetic disorders which I don't seem to have uh I've I've been very blessed in that regard I went and I got a colonoscopy ahead of schedule because I had blood in my stool and I was concerned about it and um thankfully no cancer uh but you know you want to be on top of those things an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and a big part of preventing things is exercise right that's like the the health exercise or like the uh the the diet exercise sleep triangle right the thing that everybody should be thinking about as they age so anyway this I'll get off my soap box but that is my immediate response to why I think so many programmers are Runners because they're also probably pretty smart like well adjusted people who who do want to optimize for like a long healthy life yeah I mean and it totally is a great way to do that um I think on the subject of of viewing bodies as machine um and this might be a great like last question to talk about on our podcast today um we've talked about a lot of like different sci-fi and and interesting media related to programming or technology or AI today from Westworld to her to I think you mentioned Minority Report and Y A couple others but I guess like you have any recommendations for me like what are your favorite like books movies um TV shows within the genre medium like for any of the listeners maybe go check out I I have also read and watched all of the things you just mentioned and they're all amazing yeah I mean I would just say like if you haven't seen her you should watch that that's definitely the best kind of Singularity movie I've ever seen um I think it's the most realistic frankly I think the machines are going to just be these kind of benevolent like they're just going to see humans as like oh whatever you know like go do your little human things we're going to be doing our super intelligence thing over here you know there could be some dark feature like I used to watch a lot of like cyberp Punk and dystopian stuff and read all the William Gibson novels and all that stuff and I I'm not that pessimistic anymore I'm much more optimistic so I think her is is pretty optimistic as a movie in general like if we're going to have a singularity hopefully that's the singularity we have where the AIS are too interested in like recreating Mark Twain and talking to him than uh than like figuring out a way to like you know turn all the humans into paperclips so to speak the the famous Nick Bostrom paperclip problem of if you give it an AI something to optimize I I mean rather than recommending science fiction movies and stuff books like I'll be completely C I don't have a lot of time to to consume fiction these days almost everything I watch is like a documentary but um again any good ones of those her her would be my recommendation again probably everybody's already seen it rewatch The Matrix uh Trilogy a lot of people like bash the the second and the third one as not that interesting or like bad CG or something um computer generated imagery CGI but I genuinely think that's a really well-made and I haven't seen the fourth one but I I genuinely think I haven't either the early the late 1990s early 2000s Matrix movies if you rewatch it there much deeper than you may have realized when you were a kid watching them and what it says about artificial intelligence what it says about The Human Condition if you really go down that that rabbit hole of like understanding The Matrix there there's a lot there like I I watched it uh maybe like five or six years ago I watched all three of them and I was just like wow so like like I never got any of this as a kid I always thought the machines were bad right they're trying to kill everybody but then the more I watched the more I realized oh this is actually like you know it's a dystopian movie because humans make it dystopian in a way so I would recommend rewatching those and maybe reading some of the the fan theories and stuff like that I'm not sure if the the orasi sisters have ever publicly talked about like exactly why like what the story is supposed to mean or anything but there's a lot there and it's of course certainly the first one is an amazing movie it's one of my favorite movies of all time so would you take the blue pill or the red pill Quincy uh the red pill is the one where you go deeper in absolutely I would take that yeah because I mean I would want to know I I wouldn't be content like that guy that wants to get put back in The Matrix I would never want to do that like once you know something you can't turn back you know you got to be true to yourself you can't delude yourself um and I think most strong you know people would would not succumb to that kind of uh temptation of wanting to go back to being ignorant I don't think there's any uh turning back the clocks what about you you probably have a lot more recommend what are what are some uh some science fiction uh that you would recommend if people want to have a good feel for like AI good cases bad cases oh the expanse the creators is pretty good they they've said in the future AI like in the expans universe AI doesn't even really matter that much like it's doing all kinds of things passively like what you were saying earlier about like contextual or what was the term you used where AI just figures out what needs to be done proactive Compu proactive yes so there's tons of proactive AI it's like figuring out like all the different little minor calibrations that the ship needs to make while the pilot is sitting there actually doing like the most I guess important highle decisions and then those decisions are cascading down through all throughout the ship systems so AI is there but in the expans universe AI is not that Earth changing of a thing or I guess solar system changing of a thing it's just a thing that is a tool that they use and there wasn't some like big AI war or anything like that in the expanse history uh that was just you know how they do it and to some extent Star Trek similarly AI is just another tool it's one of many fascinating Technologies alongside teleportation Tri quarters you know all these different tools right yeah um the expans is a great one although there's not a whole lot of like AI as part of that story um I think if I think about great movies that are in this this area or genre um absolutely love both Blade Runner movies um those are both really good this don't sleep on the sequel It's good the sequel the sequel's super underrated um with Ryan goling absolutely like I think the maybe equally good depiction of um like a personal AI as like the one in her um exmachina is also one that people sleep on sometimes um good movie I saw that yeah um I also like I I think there's a lot of really good TV and and books in this genre um Westworld is very sadly cancelled I'm really like I only saw the first two seasons the first season was much better than the second season did you watch the first season was incredible yeah I watched the whole show there's four seasons actually oh okay um I think that they sort of went back to basics with the fourth season um and then they kind of left I think they knew it was going to get canceled so they kind of left it on like an ending that's sort of unsatisfying but still like relatively ties things up kind of um but that has so many interesting questions about Consciousness and exploitation and um like what it means to be human versus like uh an artificial intelligence or a machine like definitely really interesting questions that aren't fully explored but like are at least asked kind of in the same way that like L does um Dune is actually really interesting even though though there's no AI in it because their history of Dune is that there was this like massive AI war and then they just like got rid of all the AI afterwards that's very battles Star Galactica so that's another show like I watched like the I guess it was the 90s battles Star Galactica early 2000s and that is all about Ai and the dangers of AI you can't Network computers because the moment you network them you run the risk of them becoming super intelligent and plotting against humans and they're they're basically fighting this entire race of artificial beings that they've constructed and they've been at this this ly War and the machines are trying to annihilate the humans really cool yeah I mean I mentioned claraa and the sun before um but that book is also about like sort of a a dystopian World in which people are like sort of genetically um designer babies um but also they have like AI tutors sort of that live with them it's like a very um like sort of Slice of Life Book that has like some deeper subtext um yeah I mean I think there's like even something as simple as like Mary Shell's Frankenstein like these are books that don't really have necessarily anything to do with AI like in the surface level um but it it fundamentally is about like mankind trying to like sort of play God yeah and what does that that's is on some level what we're doing here and what does that mean for us to be trying to create like intelligence beyond our own um there's a lot of interesting questions there yeah and what does intelligence beyond our own mean because humans when you group them together can make pretty big important decision I mean you could argue that like the economy is a whole bunch of IND you know individual self you know um I guess self-interested actors that has the net effect of us having you know this abundance that we have today for for example right um so like emergent behavior from different species like leaf cutter ants uh we we were uh we were hanging out with some leaf cutter ants the other day and uh my kids were terrified of them but we we spent some time watch some documentaries about how they work and stuff it's fascinating and it's just emergent behavior from lots of entities together and uh yeah so will we have a super intelligence that not only exceeds individual human beings but exceeds the compute of the entire human kind of wetware network that is I gu we'll see right yeah we'll might be in our lifetimes yeah I mean imagine the answer is yes we will eventually have that it's just a what's the timeline are we talking you know Blade Runner timeline or are we talking uh you know the expans timeline or Star Trek timeline right 2049 could be yeah we'll see awesome well it's been such a blast talking with you I mean we talked about so many different things uh I am going to leave videos uh your courses that you've created uh your AI course Ai and safety and also safe. aai which is a charity that's I think largely funded by uh AI companies including open AI they have an AI course that we published on free C Camp as well uh that I think uh is much more detail oriented than yours but yours is like the broad sweeping like here's a framework for thinking about AI safety and here are the you know just some of the many considerations and why AI safety is important so if you want to watch the safe AI course I recommend watching Seth's course first um and I will link to both in the show notes as well and then um yeah I mean thanks for everything you're doing for the free C cam community Through teaching these courses uh thanks for you know developing these tools and uh continuing to push forward the state-ofthe-art we're very excited to see what you all come off with next thanks for having me Quincy it was a blast until next week happy coding\", metadata={'source': 'Ixsr2RyZcv4', 'title': 'AI and

      "[Document(page_content=\"this machine learning course is created for beginners who are learning in 2024 the course begins with a machine learning road map for 2024 emphasizing career paths and beginner-friendly Theory then the course moves on to Hands-On practical applications and a comprehensive end to-end project using python Todd have created this course she is an experienced data science professional her aim is to demystify machine learning Concepts making them accessible and actionable for newcomers and to bridge the gap in existing educational resources setting you on a path to success in the evolving field of machine learning looking to step into machine learning or data science it's about starting somewhere practical yet powerful in this introductory course machine learning for beginners we are going to cover the basics of machine learning and we're going to put that into practice by implementing it in a real world case study I'm d founder of Lun Tech where we are making data science and AI more accessible for individuals and businesses if you're looking for machine learning deep learning data science or AI resources then check out the free resources section in lunch. or our YouTube channel where you can find more content and you can dive into machine learning and in AI we're going to start with machine learning road map we in this detailed section we are going to discuss the exact skill set that you need to get into machine learning we're also going to cover the definition of machine learning what is a common career path and lot of resources that you can use in order to get into machine learning then we are going to start with the actual Theory we are going to touch base the basics we're going to learn what are those different fundamentals in machine learning once we have learned the theory and we have also looked into the machine learning road map we're going to put our Theory into practice we are going to conduct an endtoend a basic yet powerful case study where we're are going to implement the linear aggression model we're going to use it both for caal analysis and for Predictive Analytics for Californian house prices we're are going to find out the features that drive the Californian house values and we are going to discuss the stepbystep approach for conducting a real world data science project at the end of this course you are going to to know the exact machine learning road map for 2024 what are the exact skill set and the action plan that you can use to get into machine learning and in data science you are going to learn the basics when it comes to machine learning you're going to implement it into actual machine learning project end to end including implementing pandas numai psychic learn touch models medal tap and curn in Python for a real world data science project dive into machine learning with us start Simple Start strong let's get started hi there in this video we are going to talk about how you can get into machine learning in 2024 first we are going to start with all the skills that you need in order to get into machine learning step by step what are the topics that you need to cover and what are the topics that you need to study in order to to get into machine learning we are going to talk about what is machine learning then we are going to cover step by step what are the exact topics and the skills that you need in order to become a machine learning researcher or just get into machine learning then we're going to cover the type of exact projects you can complete so examples of portfolio projects in order to put it on your resume and to start to apply for machine learning related jobs and then we are going to also talk about the type of industries that you can get into once you have all the skills and you want to get into machine learning so the exact career path and what kind of business titles are usually related to machine learning we are also going to talk about the average salary that you can expect for each of those different machine learning related positions at the end of this video you are going to know what exactly machine learning is where is it used what kind of skills are there that you need in order to get into to machine learning in 2024 and what kind of career path with what kind of compensation you can expect with the corresponding business titles when you want to start your career in machine learning so we will first start with the definition of machine learning what machine learning is and what are the different sorts of applications of machine learning that you most likely have heard of but you didn't know that it was based on machine learning so what is machine learning machine learning is a brand of artificial intelligence of AI that helps to uh build models based on the data and then learn from this data in order to make different decisions and it's being used across different Industries uh starting from healthare till entertainment in order to improve uh the customer uh experience custom identify customer behavior um improve the sales for the businesses uh and it also helps um governments to make decisions so it's really has a wide range of applications so let's start with the healthcare for instance machine learning is being used in the healthcare to help with the uh diagnosis of diseases it can help to uh diagnose cancer uh during the co it helped many hospitals to identify whether people are getting more uh severe side effects or they are getting p uh pneumonia um based on those pictures and that was all based on machine learning and specifically comp computer vision uh in the healthcare is also being used for drug Discovery it's being used for personalized medicine for personalizing treatment plans to improve the operations of the hospitals to understand what is the amount of uh people and uh patients that hospital can expect in each of those uh uh days per week and also to estimate the amount of doctors that need to be available the amount of uh people uh that the hospital can expect in the emergency room based on the day or the time of the day and this is basically not a machine learning application then we have uh machine learning in finance machine learning is being largely used in finance for different applications starting from fraud detection in credit cards or in other sorts of banking operations um it's also being used in trading uh with specifically in combination with quantitative Finance to help traders to make decisions with they need to go short or long into different stocks or bonds or different assets just in general to estimate the price that those talks will happen Assets in the real time in the most accurate way uh it's also being used in uh retail uh it helps you understand an estimated demand for certain products in certain warehouses it also helps you understand what is the most appropriate or closest uh uh warehouses that the items for that corresponding customer should be shipped so it's uh optimizing the operations it's also being used to build different direct Commander systems and search engines like the famous Amazon is doing so every time when you go to Amazon and you are searching for project or product you will most likely see many article recommenders and that's based on machine learning because Amazon is uh Gathering the data and comparing your behavior So based on what you have bought based on what you are searching uh to other customers and those items to other items in order to understand what are the items that you will most likely will be interested in and eventually will buy it and that's exactly based on machine learning and specifically different sorts of recommended system algorithm and then we have uh marketing where machine learning is being heavily used because this can help to understand uh what are these different tactics and specific targeting uh groups that that you belong and how retailers can Target you uh in order to reduce their marketing cost and to result in high conversion rates so to ensure that you buy their product then we have machine learning in autonomous vehicles that's based on machine learning and specifically uh deep learning applications uh and then we have also um uh natural language Pro processing which is highly related to the famous Chad GPT I'm sure you are using it and that's that's based on the machine learning and specifically the large language models so the Transformers large language models where you are going and providing your text and then question and the chat GPT will provide answer to you or in fact any other uh virtual assistant or chat boats those are all based on machine learning and then we have also uh smart home devices so Alexa is based on machine learning also in agriculture uh machine learning is being used heavily these days to estimate what the weather conditions will be uh to understand what will be the uh production of different plants uh what will be the um outcome of this uh to understand and to make decisions uh also how they can optimize those uh crop uh yields to monitor uh soil health and for different sorts of applications that can just in general uh improve the uh revenue for the farmer then we have of course in the entertainment so the Vivid example is Netflix that uses the uh data uh that you are providing uh related to the movies and also based on what kind of movies you are watching Netflix is uh building this super smart recommender system to recommend you movies that you most likely will be interested in and you will also like it so in all this machine learning is being used and it's actually super powerful topic and super powerful uh field to get into and in the upcoming 10 years this is only going to grow so if you have made that decision or you are about to make that decision to get into machine learning continue watching this video because I'm going to tell you exactly what kind of skills you need and what kind of uh practice projects you can complete in order to get into machine learning in 2024 so you first need to start with mathematics you Al also need to know python you also need to know statistics you will need to know machine learning and you will need to know some NLP to get into machine learning so let's now unpack each of those skill sets so independent the type of machine learning you are going to do you need to know mathematics and specifically you need to know linear algebra so you need to know what is matrix multiplication what are the vectors matrices dot product you need to know how you can uh multiply those different matrices Matrix with vectors what are these different rules the dimensions also what does it mean to transform a matrix the inverse of the Matrix identity Matrix diagonal matrix uh those are all Concepts as part of linear algebra that you need to know as part of your mathematical skill set in order to understand those different machine learning algorithms then as part of your mathematics you also need to to know calculus and specifically differential Theory so you need to know these different theorems such as chain rule the rule of uh differentiating when you have sum of instances when you have constant multiply with an instance when you have um uh sum but also subtraction division multiplication of two items and then you need to take the uh derivative of that what is this idea of derivative what is the idea of partial derivative what is the idea of Haitian so first order derivative second order derivative and it would be also great to know a basic integration Theory so we have differentiation and the opposite of it is integration Theory so this is kind of basic you don't need to know uh too much when it comes to calculus but those are basic things that you need to know uh in order to succeed in machine learning uh then the next Concepts uh such as discrete mathematics so you need to know uh what is this idea of uh graph Theory uh what are this uh combinations combinators uh what is uh this idea of complexity which is important when you want to become a machine learning engineer because you need to understand what is this Big O notation so you need to understand what is this complexity of uh n s complexity of n complexity of n log n um and about that you need to know uh some basic um mathematics when it comes which comes from usually high school so you need to know multiplication division you need to understand uh multiplying uh uh amounts which are within the parentheses you need to understand um different symbols that represent mathematical um values you need to know this idea of using X's y's uh and then what is X2 what is y^ 2 What is X to ^ 3 so different exponents of the different VAR variables then you need to know what is logarithm what is logarithm at the base of two what is logarithm at the base of e and then at the base of 10 uh what is the idea of e so what is the idea of Pi uh what is this idea of uh exponent logarithm and how does those uh transform when it comes to taking derivative of the logarithm taking

learning skill set that you just learned uh so there are few projects that I suggest you to complete and you can put it this on your resume to start to apply for machine learning roles the first application the project that I would suggest you to do is building a basic recommender system whether it's a job recommender system or a movie recommender system in this way you can showcase how you can use for instance text Data from those job advertisement how you can use numeric data such as the ratings of the movies in order to build a topend recommender system this will showcase your understanding of the distance measures such as cosign similarity this Cann algorithm idea and this will help you to uh uh tackle this specific uh area of data science and machine learning the next project I would suggest you to do will be to build a regression based model so in this way you will showcase that you understand this idea of regression how to work with a Predictive Analytics and predictive model that has a dependent variable response variable that is in the numeric format so here for instance you can uh estimate the salaries of the jobs based on the uh characteristics of the uh job based on this data which you can get for instance from uh open source uh web pages such as keegle and you can then uh use different sorts of regression algorithms to perform your predictions of the salaries evaluate the model and then compare the uh performance of the different machine learning regression based algorithms for instance you can use the uh linear regression you can use the decision trees regression version you can use the um uh random Forest you can use uh GBM xgo in order to Showcase and then in one uh graph to compare this uh performance of these different algorithms by using single regression uh ml modal metrics so for instance the rmsc this project will showcase that you understand how you can train a regression model how you can test it and validate it and it will showcase your understanding of optimization of this regression algorithm you understand this concept of hyperparameter unit the next project that I would suggest you to do in order to Showcase your classification knowledge so when it comes to uh predicting a class for an observation given uh the feature space would be uh to uh build a classification model that would classify emails being a Spam or not a Spam so you can use a publicly available data that will be uh describing a specific email and then you will have multiple emails and the idea is to uh build a machine learning model that would classify the email to the class zero and class one where class zero for instance can be your uh not being a Spam and one being a Spam so with this binary classification you will showcase that you know how to train a machine learning model for classification purposes and you can here use for instance logistic regression you can use also the decision Trea for classification case you can also use random Forest the uh EG she Bo for classification GBM for classification and uh with all these models you can then obtain the performance metrics such as uh F1 score or you can put the rck curve uh or the uh area under the Curve metrics and you can also compare those different classification models so in this way you will also tackle another area of expertise when it comes to the machine learning then a final project that I would suggest you to do would be uh from the unsupervised learning to Showcase another area of expertise and here you can for instance use data to your customers into good better and best customers based on their transaction history the amount of uh money that they are spending in the store so uh in this case you can for instance use K means uh DB scan hierarchy clustering and then you can evaluate your uh clustering algorithms and then select the one that performs the best so you will then in this case cover yet another area of machine learning which would be super important to show case that you can not only handle recommended systems or supervised learning but also unsupervised learning and the reason why I suggest you to uh cover all these different areas and complete this four different projects is because in this way you will be covering different expertise and areas of machine learning so you will be also putting projects on

go beyond the basic or medium level and you want to be considered for medium or Advanced machine learning uh levels and positions you also need to know bit more advanced which means that you need to complete bit more advanced projects for instance if you want to apply for generative AI related or large language models related positions I would suggest you to complete a project where you are building a very basic uh large language model and specifically the pre-training process which is the most difficult one so in this case uh for instance you can build a baby GPT and I'll put a here link that you can follow where I'm building a baby GPT a basic pre-trained GPT algorithm where uh I am using a text Data uh publicly available data in order to uh uh process data in the same way like GPT is doing and the encoded part of the Transformer in this way you will showcase to your um hiring managers that you understand this architecture behind Transformers architecture behind the um uh large language models and the gpts and you understand how you can use pytorch in Python in order to do this Advanced NLP and generative AI task and finally let's now talk about the common career path and the business titles that you can expect from a career in machine learning so assuming that you have gained all the skills uh that are must for breaking into machine learning there are different sorts of business titles that you can apply in order to get into machine learning so when it comes to machine learning uh you can uh get into machine learning uh and there are different fields that are covered as part of this so uh first we have the general machine learning researcher machine learning researcher is basically doing a research so training testing evaluating different machine learning algorithms they are usually people who come from academic background but it doesn't mean that you cannot get into machine learning research without getting a degree in statistics mathematics or in um um machine learning specifically not at all so uh if you have this um desire and this passion for reading doing research uh and you don't mind reading uh research papers then machine learning res researcher job would be a good fit for you so machine learning combined with research then sets you uh for the machine learning researcher role then we have the machine learning engineer so machine learning engineer is the engineering version of the machine learning uh expertise which means that we are combining machine learning skills with the engineering skills such as productionizing pipelines or end to end robust pipeline scalability of the m model considering all these different aspects of the model not only from the performance side when it comes to the quality of the algorithm but also the uh scalability of it and when putting it in front of many users so when it comes to combining engineering with machine learning then you get machine learning engineering so if you are someone who is a software engineer and you want to get into machine learning then machine learning engineering would be the best fit for you so so for machine learning engineering you not only need to have all these different skills that I already mentioned but you also need to have this good grasp of uh uh scalability of algorithms the uh uh data structures and algorithms type of um skill set uh the uh complexity of the moral uh also system design so this one uh converges more towards and similar to the software engineering position combined with machine learning red than your pure machine learning or AI role then we have the AI research versus AI engineering position so uh the uh AI research position is similar to The Machine learning uh research position and the AI engineer position is similar to The Machine learning engineer position with only single difference when it comes to machine learning we are specifically talking about the traditional machine learning so linear regression logistic regression and also uh random Forest exy boost begging and when it comes to AI research and AI engineer position here we are tackling more the advanced machine learning so here we are talking about deep learning models such as RNN lstms grus CNN or computer vision applications and we are also talking about uh generative AI models large language models so uh we are talking about um the Transformers implementation of Transformers the gbts T5 all these different algorithms that are from uh more advanced uh AI topics rather than traditional machine learning uh for those you will then be applying for AI research and AI engineering positions and finally you have these different sorts of obervations niches from AI for instance NLP research NLP engineer or even data science positions for which you will need to know machine learning and knowing machine learning will set you apart for the source of positions so also the business titles such as data science or technical data science positions NLP researcher NLP engineer for this all uh you will need to know machine learning and knowing machine learning will help you to break into those positions and those career

link to this course and to this uh case study in the link below and once you have gained all the skills you are ready to get into machine learning in 2024 in this lecture we will go through the basic concepts in machine learning that is needed to understand and follow conversations and solve main problems using machine learning strong understanding of machine learning Basics is an important step for anyone looking to learn more about or work with machine learning we'll be looking at the three concepts in this tutorial we will Define and look into the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning models then we will look into the difference between the regression and classification type of machine learning models after this we will look into the process of training machine learning models from scratch and how to evaluate them by introducing performance metrics what you can use depending on the type of machine learning model or problem you are dealing with so whether it's a supervised or unsupervised whether it's regression versus classification type of problem machine learning methods are categorized into two types depending on the existence of the label data in the training data set which is especially important in the training process so we are talking about the So-Cal dependent variable that we so in the section of fundamental Su statistics supervised and unsupervised machine learning models are two main type of machine learning algorithms one key difference between the two is the level of supervision during the training phase supervised machine learning algorithms are Guided by the labeled examples while as supervised algorithms are not as learning model is more reliable but it also requires a larger amount of labeled data which can be timec consuming and quite expensive to obtain examples of supervised machine learning models include regression and classification type of models on the other hand unsupervised machine learning algorithms are trained on unlabeled data the model must find patterns and relationships in the data without the guidance of correct outputs so we no longer have a dependent variable so unsupervised ml models require training data that consists only of independent variables or the features and there is no dependent variable or label data that can supervise the algorithm when learning from the data examples of unsupervised models are clust string models and outlier detection techniques supervised machine learning methods are categorized into two types depending on the type of dependent variable they are predicting so we have regression type and we have classification type some key differences between regression and classification include output type so the regression algorithms predict continuous values while the classification algorithms predict categorized values some key difference between regression and classification include the output type the evaluation metrics and their applications so with regards to the output type regression algorithms predict continuous values while classification algorithms predict categorical values with regard to the evaluation metric different evaluation metrics are being used for regression and classification tasks for example mean square is commonly used to evaluate regression models while accuracy is commonly used to evaluate classification models when it comes to Applications regression and classification models are used in entirely different types of applications regression models are often used for prediction tests while classifications are used for decision making tasks progression algorithms are used to predict the continuous value such as price or probability for example a regression model might be used to predict the price of a house based on its size location or other features examples of regression type of machine learning models are linear regression fixed effect regression exus regression Etc classification algorithms on the other hand are used to predict the categorical value these algorithms take an input and classify it to one of the several predetermined categories for example a classification model might be used to classify emails as a Spam or as not a Spam or to identify the type of animal in an image examples of classification type of machine learning models are logistic regression exus classification random Forest classification let us now look into different typee of performance metrics we can use in order to evaluate different type of machine learning models for aggression models common evaluation Matrix includes residual sum of squared which is the RSS mean squared error which is the msse the root mean squared error or rmsc and the mean absolute error which is the m AE this metrix measure the difference between the predicted values and the True Values with a lower value indicating a better feed for the model so let's go through this metrics one by one the first one is the RSS or the residual sum of squares this is a matrix commonly used in the setting of linear regression when we are evaluating the performance of the model in estimating the different coefficients and here the beta is a coefficient and the Yi is our dependent variable value and the Y head is the predicted value as you can see the RSS or the residual sum of square or the beta is equal to sum of all the squ of Y IUS y hat across all I is equal to 1 n where I is the index of the each r or the individual or the observation included in the data the second Matrix is the m or the mean squared error which is the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the True Values so as you can see m is equal to 1 / to n and then sum across all i y i minus y head squ as you can see the RSS and the msse are quite similar in terms of their uh formulas the only difference is that we are adding a 1 / to n and then this makes it the average across all the square differences between the predicted value and the actual true valum a lower value of msse indicates a better fit the rmsc which is the root mean squared error is the square root of the msse so as you can see it has the same formula as msse only with the difference that we are adding a square roof on the top of that formula a lower value of rmsc indicates a better fit and finally the Mae or the mean absolute error is the average absolute difference between the predicted values so the Y hat and the True Values or y i a lower value of this indicates a better fit the choice of a regression metrics depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve and the nature of your data for instance the MSE is commonly used when you want to penalize large errors more than the small ones MSE is sensitive to outliers which means that it may not be the best choice when your data contains many outliers or extreme values rmsc on the other hand which is the square root of the MSC makes it easier to interpret so it's easier interpretable because it's in the same units as Target variable it is commonly used when you want to compare the performance of different models or when you want to report the error in a way that it's easier to understand and to explain the Mia is commonly used when you want to penalize all errors equally regardless of their magnitude and Mia is less sensitive to outliers compared to msse for classification models common evaluation metrics include accuracy precision recall and F1 score this metrics measure the ability of the machine learning model to correctly classify instances into the correct categories let's briefly look into this metrix individually so the accuracy is a proportion of correct predictions made by the model it's calculated by taking the correct predictions so the correct number of predictions and divide two all number of predictions which means correct predictions plus incorrect predictions next we will look into the Precision so Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model and it's equal to True positive divided to True positive plus false positive so all number of positives true positives are cases where the model correctly predict a positive outcome while false positives are the cases where the model incorrectly predict a positive outcome next Matrix is recall recall is a proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances it's calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of actual positive instances which means dividing the true positive to True positive plus false negative so for example let's say we are looking into medical test a true positive would be a case where it has correctly identifies a patient as having a disease while a false positive would be a case where the test incorrectly identifies a healthy patient as having the disease and the final score is the F1 score the F1 score is the harmonic mean or the usual mean of the Precision and recall with a higher value indicating a better balance between precision and recall and it's calculated as the two times recall times Precision divided to recall plus Precision for unsupervised models such as class string models whose performance is typically evaluated using metrics that measure the similarity of the data points within a cluster and the dis similarity of the data points between different clusters we have three type of metrics that we can use homogeneity is a measure of the degree to which all of the data points within a single cluster belong to the same class A Higher value indicates a more homogeneous cluster so as you can see homogeneity of age where age is the simply the short way of describing homogeneity is equal to one minus conditional entropy given cluster assignments divided to the entropy or predicted class if you wondering what this entropy is then stay tuned as we are going to discuss this entropy whenever we will discuss the clustering as well as decision trees X Matrix is the silid score silid score is a measure of the similarity of the data point to its own cluster compared to the other clusters a higher silid score indicates that the data point is well matched to its own cluster this is usually used for DB scan or k me so here the silhouette score can be represented by this formula so the S so or the silhouette score is equal to B minus AO divided to the maximum of AO and B where s o is The Silo coefficient of the data point characterized by o AO is the average distance between o and all the other data points in the cluster to which o belongs and the B is the minimum average distance from o to all the Clusters to which o does not belong the final metrix we look to is the completeness completeness is another measure of the degree to which all of the data points that belongs to a particular class are assigned to the same cluster a higher value indicates a more compete cluster let's conclude this lecture by going through the step-by-step process of evaluating a machine learning model at a very simplified version since there are many additional considerations and techniques that may be needed depending on a specific task and the characteristics of the data knowing how to properly train machine learning model is really important since this defines the accuracy of the results and conclusions you will make the training Pro process starts with the preparing of the data this includes splitting the data into training and test sets or if you are using more advanced resampling techniques that we will talk about later than splitting your data into multiple sets the training set of your data is used to feed the model if you have also a validation set then this validation set is used to optimize your hyperparameters and to pick the best model while the test set is to use to evaluate the model performance when when we will approach more lectures in this section we will talk in detail about these different techniques as well as what the training means what the test means what validation means as well as what the hyperparameter tuning means secondly we need to choose an algorithm or set of algorithms and train the model on the training data and save the fitted model there are many different algorithms to choose from and the appropriate algorithm will depend on the specific test task and the characteristics of the data as a third step we need to adjust the model parameters to minimize the error on the training set by performing hyperparameter tuning for this we need to use validation data and then we can select the best model that results in the least possible validation error rate in this step we want to look for the optimal set of parameters that are included as part of our model to end up with a model that has the least possible error so it performs in the best possible way in the final two steps we need to evaluate the model we are always interested in a test a rate and not the training or the validation error rates because we have not used a test set but we have used the training and validation sets so this test error rate will give you an idea of how well the model will generalize to the new unseen data we need to use the optimal set of parameters from hyperparameter tuning stage and the training data to train the model again with this hyper parameters and with the best model so we can use the best fitted model to get the predictions on the test data and this will help us to calculate our test error rate once we have calculated the test error rate and we have also obtained our best model we are ready to save the predictions so once we are satisfied with the model performance and we have tuned the parameters we can use it to make predictions on a new unseen data on the test data and compute the performance metrics for the model us the predictions and the real values of the target variable from the test data and this complete this lecture so in this lecture we have spoken about the basics of machine learning we have discussed the difference between the the unsupervised and supervised learning models as well as regression versus classification we have discussed in details the different type of performance metrics we can use to evaluate different type of machine learning models as well as we have looked into the simplified version of the step-by-step process to train the machine machine learning model in this lecture lecture number two we will discuss a very important Concepts which you need to know before considering and applying any statistical or machine learning model here I'm talking about the bias of the model and the variance of the model and the trade of between the two which we call bias various trade of whenever you are using a statistical econometrical or a machine learning model no matter how simple the model is you should always evaluate your model and check its error rate in all this cases it comes down to the trade-off you make between the variance of the model and the bias of your model because there is always a catch when it comes to the model choice and the performance let us firstly Define what bias and the variant of the machine learning model are the inability of the model to capture the true relationship in the data is called bias hence the machine learning models that are able to detect the true relationship in the data have low bias usually complex models or more flexible models tend to have a lower bias than simpler models so mathematically the bias of the model can be expressed as the expectation of the difference between the estimate and the True Value let us also Define the variance of the model the variance of the model is the inconsistency level or the variability of the model performance when applying the model to different data sets when the same model that is trained using training data performs entirely differently than on the test data this means that there is a large variation or variance in the model complex models or more flexible models tend to have a higher variance than simpler models in order to evaluate the performance of the model we need to look at the amount of error that the model is making for Simplicity let's assume we have the following simple regression model which aims to use a single independent variable X to model the numeric y dependent variable that is we fit our model on our training observations where we have a pair of independent and dependent variables X1 y1 X2 Y2 up to xn YN and we obtain an estimate for our training observations fhe we can then compute this let's say fhe X1 fhe X2 up to fhe xn which are the estimat for our dependent variable y1 Y2 up to YN and if these are approximately equal to this actual values so one head is approximately equal to y1 Y2 head is approximately equal to Y2 head Etc then the training error rate would be small however if we are really interested in whether our model is predicting the dependent variable appropriately we want to instead of looking at the training error rate we want to look at our test error rate so so the error rate of the model is the expected Square difference between the real test values and their prediction where the predictions are made using the machine learning model we can rewrite this aor rate as a sum of two quantities where as you can see the left part is the amount of FX minus F hat x^ squared and the second entity is the variance of the error term so the accuracy of Y head as a prediction for y depends on the two quantities which we can call the reducible error and the irreducible error so this is the reducible error equal to FX minus f x s and then we have our irreducible error or the variance of Epsilon so the accuracy of Y head as a prediction for y depends on the two quantities which we can call the reducible error and the irreducible error in general The Fad will not be a perfect estimate for f and this inaccuracy will introduce some errors this error is reducible since we can potentially improve the accuracy of fad by using the most appropriate machine learning model and the best version of it to estimate the F however even if it was possible to find a model that would estimate F perfectly so that the estimated response took the form of Y head is equal to FX our prediction would still have some error in it this happens because Y is also a function of the error rate Epsilon which by definition cannot be predicted by using our feature X so there will always be some error that is not predictable so variability associated with the error Epsilon also affects the accuracy of the predictions and this is known as the irreducible error because no matter how well we will estimate F we cannot reduce the error introduced by the Epsilon this error contains all the features that are not included in our model so all the unknown factors that have an influence on our dependent variable but are not included as part of our data but we can't reduce the reducible error rate which is based on two values the variance of the estimate and the bias of the model if we were to simplify the mathematical expression describing the error rate that we got then it's equal to the variance of our model plus squared bias of our model plus the irreducible error so even if we cannot reduce the irreducible error we can reduce the reducible error rate which is based on the two values the variance and the squared bias so though the mathematical derivation is out of the scope of this course just keep in mind that the reducible error of the model can be described as the sum of the variance of the model and a squared bias of the model so mathematically the error in the supervised machine learning model is equal to the squared bias in the model the variance of the model and the irreducible error therefore in order to minimize the expected test error rate so on the Unseen data we need to select the machine learning meod that simultaneously achieves low variance and low bias and that's exactly what we call called bias variance tradeoff the problem is is that there is a negative correlation between the variance and the bias of the model another thing that is highly related to the bias and the variance of the model is the flexibility of the machine learning model so flexibility of the machine learning model has a direct impact on its variance and on its bias let's look at this relationships one by one so complex models or more flexible models tend to have a lower bias but at the same time complex models or flexible models tend to have higher variance than simpler models so as the flexibility of the model increases the model finds the true patterns in the data easier which reduces the bias of the model at the same time the variance of such models increases so as the flexibility of the model decreases model finds it more difficult to find the true parents in the data which then increases the bias of the morel but also decreases the variance of the model keep this topic in mind and we will continue this topic in the next next lecture when we will be discussing the topic of overfitting and how to solve the overfitting problem by using regularization in this lecture lecture number three we will talk about very important concept called overfitting and how we can solve overfitting by using different techniques including regularization this topic is related to the previous lecture and to the topics of error of the model train error rate test error rate bias and a variance of the machine learning model overfitting is important to know and also how to solve it with regularization because this topic can lead to inaccurate predictions and the lack of generalization of the model to new data knowing how to detect and prevent overfitting is crucial in building effective machine learning models questions about this topic are almost guaranteed to appear during every single data science interview in the previous lecture we discuss the relationship between model flexibility and the variance as well as the bias of the model we saw that as the flexibility of the model increases model finds the true pattern in the data easier which reduces the bias of the model but at the same time the variance of such models increases so as the flexibility of the model decreases model finds it more difficult to find the true patterns in the data which then increases the bias of the model and decreases the variance of the model let's first formally Define what the overfitting problem is as well as what the underfitting is so overfitting occurs when the model performs well in the training while the model performs worse on the test data so you end up having a low training error rate but a high test error rate and in the ideal world we want our test error rate to be low or at least that the training a rate is equal to the test error rate overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the detail and noise in training data to the point where it negatively impacts the performance of the model on this new data so the model follows the data too closely closer than it should this means that the noise or random fluctuations of the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model which it should actually ignore the problem is that the noise or random component of the training data will be very different from the noise in the new data the model will therefore be less effective in making predictions on new data overfitting is caused by having too many features too complex of a model or too little of the data when the model is overfitting then also the model has high variance and low bias usually the higher is the model flexibility the higher is the risk of overfitting because then we have higher risk of having a model following the data too closely and following the noise so underfitting is the other way around underfitting occurs when our test error rate is much lower than our training error rate given that overfitting is much bigger of a problem and we want ideally to fix the case when our test theate is large we will only focus on the overfitting and this also the topic that you can expect during your data science interviews as well as something that you need to be aware of whenever you are training a machine learning model all right so now we we know what overfitting is we should now talk about how we can fix this problem there are several ways of fixing or preventing overfitting first you can reduce the complexity of the model we saw that higher the complexity of the model higher is the chance of the following the data including the noise too closely resulting in overfitting therefore reducing the flexibility of the model will reduce the overfitting as well this can be done by using a simpler model with fewer parameters or by applying a regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization that we will talk in a bit kind solution is to collect more data the more data you have the less likely your model will overfit third and another solution is using resampling techniques one of which is cross validation this is a technique that allows you to train and test your model on different subsets of your data which can help you to identify if your model is overfitting we will discuss cross validation as well as other re sampling techniques later in the section another solution is to apply early stopping early stopping is a technique where you monitor the performance of the model on a validation set during the training process and stop the training when the performance starts to decrease another solution is to use assemble methods by combining multiple models such as decision trees overfitting can be reduced we will be covering many popular emble techniques in this course as well finally you can is what we call dropout dropout is a regularization technique for reducing overfitting in narrow networks by dropping out or setting to zero some of the neurons during the training process because from time to time Dropout related questions do appear during the data science interviews for people with no experience so if someone asks you about Dropout then at least you will remember that it's a technique used to solve overfitting in the setting of deep learning it's worth noting that there is no one solution that works for all types of overfitting and often a group of these techniques that we just talk about should be used to address the problem we saw that when the model is overfitting then the model has high variance and low bias by definition regularization or what we also call shrinkage is a method that shrinks some of the estimated coefficients toward zero to penalize unimportant variables for increasing the variance of the model this is a technique used to solve the overfitting problem by introducing the lethal bias in the model was significantly decreasing its variance there are three types of regularization techniques that are widely known in the industry the first one is to reach regression or L2 regularization the second one is the ler regression or the L1 regularization and finally the third one is the Dropout which is a regularization technique used in deep learning we will cover the first two types in this lecture let's now talk about re regression or L2 regularization so re regression or L2 regularization is a shrinkage technique that aims to solve overfitting by shrinking some of the modor coefficients towards zero retrogression introduces latal bias into the model while significantly reducing the model variance R regression is a variation of linear regression but instead of trying to minimize the sum of squared residuales that linear regression does it aims to minimize the sum of squared residuales added on the top of the squared coefficients what we call L2 regularization term let's look at a multiple linear regression example with P independent variables or predictors that are used to model the dependent variable y if you have followed the statistical section of this course you might also recall that the most popular estimation technique to estimate the parameter of the linear regression assuming its assumptions are satisfied is the ordinary Le squares or the OLS which finds the optimal coefficients by minimizing the sum of squared residuales or the RSS so re regression is pretty similar to the OS except that the coefficients are estimated by minimizing a slightly different cost or loss function this is the loss function of the re regession where beta J is the coefficient of the model for variable J beta0 is the intercept and x i j is the input value for the variable J and observation I Yi is a target variable or the dependent variable for observation Y and N is the number of samples and Lambda is what we call regularization parameter of the r regression so this is the loss function of OLS that you can see here and added a penalization term so it's combined the what we call RSS so if you check out the very initial lecture in this section where we spoke about different metrics that can be used to evaluate regression type of models you can see RSS and the definition of RSS well if you compare this expression then you can easily find that this is the exact formula for the RSS added with an intercept and this right term is what we called a penalty amount which basically represents the Lambda times the sum of the squar of the coefficients included in our model here Lambda which is always positive so it's always larger than equal zero is the tuning parameter or the penalty parameter this expression of the sum squared coefficients is called L2 Norm which is why we call this L2 penalty based regression or L2 regularization in this way regression assigns a penalty by shrinking their coefficients towards zero reduces the overall model variance but this coefficient will never become exactly zero so the model parameters are never said to exactly zero which means that all P predictors of the model are still intact this one is a key property of retrogression to keep in mind that it shrinks the parameters towards zero but never exactly sets them equal to zero L2 Norm is a mathematical term coming from linear algebra and it's standing for alian Norm we spoke about the penalty parameter lum LDA what we also call the tuning parameter Lambda which serves to control the relative impact of the penalty on the regression coefficient estimates when the Lambda is equal to zero the penalty term has no effect and the re regression will introduce the ordinary Le squares estimates but as the Lambda increases the impact of the shrinkage penalty grows and the r regression coefficient estimates approach to zero what is important to keep in mind which you can also see from this graph is that in r agression large Lambda will assign a penalty to some variables by shrinking their coefficients towards zero but they will never become exactly zero which becomes a problem when you are dealing with a model that has a large number of features and your model has a low interpretability retrogressions advantage over ordinarily squares is coming from the earlier introduced bias Varian trade of phenomenon so as in Lambda the penalty parameter increases the flexibility of the retrogression F decreases leading to decreased variance but increased bias the main advantages of retrogression are solving overfitting which regression can shrink the regression coefficient of less important predictors towards zero it can improve the prediction accuracy as well by reducing the variance and increasing the bias of the model Rich repression is less sensitive to outliers in the data compared to linear regression Rich regression is computationally less expensive compared to class or regression the main disadvantage of R aggression is the low modal interpretability as the P so the number of features your model is large let's now look into another regularization technique called l or regression or L1 regularization by definition l or regression or L1 regularization is a shrinkage technique that aims to solve overfitting by shrinking some of the modal coefficients towards zero and setting some to exactly zero l or regression like retrogression introduces later bias into the model while significantly reducing model variance there is however small difference between the two regression techniques that makes a huge difference in their results we saw that one of the biggest disadvantages of R regression is that it will always include all the predictors or all the p predictors in the final model whereas in case of lasso it overcomes this disadvantage so large Lambda or penalty parameter will assign a penalty to some variables by shrinking their coefficients towards zero in case of Rich aggression they will never become exactly zero which becomes a problem when your model has a large number of features and it has a low interpretability and L or regression overcomes this disadvantage of retrogression let's have a look at the loss function of L regularization so this is the loss function of OLS which is a left part of the formula called RSS combined with a penalty amount which is the right hand side of the expression the Lambda times some of the absolute values of the coefficients beta J as you can see this is the RSS that we just saw which is exactly the same as the loss function of the OLS and then we are adding the second term which basically is the Lambda the penalization parameter multiplied by the sum of the absolute value of the coefficient beta J where J goes from one till p and the p is number of predictors included in now model here once again the Lambda which is always positive larger than equal Z is a tuning parameter or the penalty parameter this expression of the sum of squared coefficients is called L1 Norm which is why we call this L1 penalty based regression or L1 regularization in this way L of regression assigns a penalty to some of the variables by shrinking their coefficients towards zero and setting some of these parameters to exactly zero so this means that some of the coefficients will end up being exactly equal to zero which is a key difference between the L regression versus the reg regression the L1 Norm is a mathematical term coming from the linear alra and it's standing for man had Norm or distance you might see here a key difference when comparing the visual representation of the L regression compared to the visual representation of the reg agression so if you look at this point you can see that there will be cases where our coefficients will be set to exactly zero this is where we have this intersection whereas in case of R regression you can recall that there was not a single intersection so the numbers where the circle was closed to the intersection points but there was not a single point when there was an intersection and the coefficients were put to zero and that's the key difference between two regression type of models between the two regularization Tech techniques the main advantages of loss or regression are solving overfitting so loss or regression can shrink the regression coefficient of less important predictors toward zero and some to exactly zero as the model filters some variables out L indirectly performs also what we call feature selection such that the resulted model is highly interpretable and with less features and much more interpretable compared to the reg aggression laso can also improve the predi accuracy of the model by reducing the variance and increasing the bias of the model but not as much as the retrogression earlier when speaking about correlation we also briefly discussed the concept of causation we discuss that correlation is not a causation and we also briefly spoke the method used to determine whether there is a causation or not that model is the infamous linear aggression and even if this model is recognized as a simple approach it's one one of the few methods that allows identifying features that have an impact or statistically significant impact on a variable that we are interested in and we want to explain and it also helps you identify how and how much there is a change in the Target variable when changing the independent variable values to understand the concept of linear aggression you should also know and understand the concepts of dependent variable independent variable linearity and statistical significant effect dependent variables are often referred to as response variables or explained variables by definition dependent variable is a variable that is being measured or tested it's called the dependent variable because it's thought to depend on the independent variables so you can have one or multiple independent variables but you can have only one dependent variable that you are interested in that is your target variable let's now look into the independent variable definition so independent variables are often referred as regressors or explanatory variables and by definition independent variable is the variable that is being manipulated or controlled in the experiment and is believed to have an effect on the dependent variable put it differently the value of the dependent variable is s to depend on the value of the independent variable for example in an experiment to test the effect of having a degree on the wage the degree variable would be your independent variable and the wage would be your dependent variable finally let's look into the very important concept of statistical significance we call the effect statistically significant if it's unlikely to have occurred by random chance in other words a statistically significant effect is one that is likely to be real and not due to a random chance let's now Define the linear regression model formally and then we will dive deep into the theoretical and practical details by definition V regression is a statistical or machine learning method that can help to model the impact of a unit change in the variable the independent variable on the values of another Target variable or the dependent variable when the relationship between the two variables is assumed to be linear when the linear regression model is based on a single independent variable then we call this model simple linear regression when the model is based on multiple independent variables we call it multiple linear regression let's look at the mathematical expression describing linear regression you can recall that when the linear regression model is based on a single independent variable we just call it a simple linear regression this expression that you see here is the most common mathematical expression describing simple linear regression so you can see that we are saying that the Yi is equal to Beta 0 plus beta 1 x i plus UI in this expression the Yi is the dependent variable and the I that you see here is the index corresponding to the E row so whenever you are getting the data and you want to analyze this data you will have multiple rows and if your multiple rows describe the observations that you have in your data so it can be people it can be observation describing uh your data then the each characterizes the specific roow the each roow that you have in your data and the Yi is then variables value corresponding to that each show then the same holds for the XI so the XI is then the independent variable or the explanatory variable or the regressor that you have in your model which is the variable that we are testing so we want to manipulate it to see whether this variable has a statistically significant impact on the dependent variable y so we want to see whether the unit change in the X will result in a specific change in the Y and what kind of change is that so beta Z that you see here is not a variable and it's called intercept or constant something that is unknown so we don't have that in our data and it's one of the parameters of linear regression it's an unknown number which the linear regression model should estimate so we want to use the linear regression model to find out this uh unknown value as well as the second unknown value which is a beta one as well as we can estimate the error terms which are represented by the UR so beta one next to the XI so next to the independent variable is also not a variable so like beta zero is an unknown parameter in linear regression model an unknown number which the linear regression model should estimate beta one is often referred as a slope coefficient of variable X which is the number that quantifies how much dependent variable y will change if the independent variable X will change by one unit so that's EX exactly what we are most interested in the beta one because this is the coefficient and this is the unknown number that will help us to understand and answer the question whether our independent variable X has a statistically significant impact on our dependent variable y finally the U that you see here or the UI in the expression is the error term or the amount of mistake that the model makes when explaining the target variable we add this value since we know that we can never exactly and accurately estimate the Target variable so we will always make some amount of estimation error and we can never estimate the exact value of y hence we need to account for this mistake that we are going to make and we know in advance that we are going to have this mistake by adding an error term to our model let's also have a brief look at how multiple linear regression is usually expressed in mathematical terms so you might recall that difference between the simple linear regression and multiple linear regression is that the first one has a a single independent variable in it whereas the letter or the multiple linear regression like the name suggest has multiple independent variables in it so more than one knowing this type of Expressions is critical since they not only appear a lot in the interviews but also in general you will see them in the data science blogs in presentations in books and also in papers so being able to quickly identify and say ah I remember saying this at once then it will help you to easier understand and follow the process and the story line so uh what you see here you can read as Yi is equal to Beta 0 plus beta 1 * X1 I plus beta 2 * X2 I plus beta 3 * X3 I plus UI so this is the most common mathematical expression describing multiple linear regression in this case with three independent variables so if you were to have more independent variables you should add them with their corresponding indices and coefficients so in this case the method will aim to estimate the model parameters which are beta 0 beta 1 beta 2 and beta Tre so like before Yi is our dependent variable which is always a single one so we only have one dependent variable then we have beta 0 which is our intercept or the constant then we have our first slope coefficient which is beta 1 corresponding to our first independent variable X1 then we have X1 I which stands for the independent variable the first independent variable with an index one and the I stands for the index corresponding to the row so whenever we have multiple linear regression we always need to specify two indices and not only one like we had in our uh single linear regression the index cor that characterizes which independent variable we are referring to so whether it's independent variable one two or three and then we need to specify which row we are referring to which is the index I so you might notice that that in this case all the indices are the same because we are uh looking into one specific role and we are representing this role by using the independent variables the error term and dependent variable so then we are adding our third term which is beta 2 * x2i so the beta 2 is our third unknown parameter in the model and the second slope coefficient corresponding to our second independent variable and then we have our third independent variable with the corresponding slope coefficient beta 3 as well as we also add like always an error term to account for the error that we know that we are going to make so now when we know what the linear regression is and how to express it in the mathematical terms you might be asking the next logical question well we know that when we know what the linear regression is and how to express it in the mathematical terms you might be asking the next logical question how do we find those unknown parameters in the model in order to find out how the independent variables in impacted the dependent variable finding this unknown parameters is called estimating in data science and in general so we are interested in finding out the possible values or the values that the best approximate the unknown values in our model and we call this process estimation and one technique used to estimate linear regression parameters is called oils or ordinary Le squares so domain idea behind this approach the OLS is to find the best fitting straight line so the regression line through a set of paired X and y's so our independent variables and dependent variables values by minimizing the sum of squared errors so to minimize the sum of squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable and its values which are the predicted values that we are predicted by our model that's exactly what we want to do by by using this linear function of the independent variables the residuals so this is too much information let's go it step by step so in linear regression we just so when we are expressing our simple linear regression we have this error term and we can never know what is the actual error term but what we can do is to estimate the value of the error term which we call residual so we want to minimize the sum of squ residuales because we don't know the errors so we want to find a line that will best fit our data in such way that the error that we are making or the sum of squared errors is as small as possible and since we don't know the errors we can estimate the Errors By each time looking at the predicted value that is predicted by our model and the True Value and then we can subtract them from each other and we can see how good our model is estimating the values that we have so how good is our model estimating the unknown parameters so to minimize the sum of squar of the differences between the observed dependent variable and its values predicted by the linear function of the independent variables so the minimizing the sum of squared residuales so uh we Define the estimate of a parameters and variables by adding a hge on the top of the variables or parameters so in this case you can see that y I had is equal to Beta Z head plus beta 1 head XI so you can see that we no longer have a error term this and we say that Yi head is the estimated value of Yi and beta zero head is the estimated value of beta 0 beta 1 head is the estimated value of our beta 1 and the XI is still our data so the values that we have in our data and therefore we don't have a hat since that does not need to be estimated so what we want to do is to estimate our dependent variable and we want to compare our estimated value that we got using our OLS with the actual with the real value such that we can calculate our errors or the estimate of the error which is represented by the UI head so the UI head is equal to Yi minus Yi head where UI head is simply the estimate of the error term or the residual so this predicted error is always referred as residual so make sure that you do not confuse the error with the residual so error can never be observed error you can never calculate and you will never know but what you can do is to predict the error and you can when you predict the error then you get a recal and what oil is trying to do is to minimize the amount of airor that it's making therefore it looks at the sum of squared residuales across all the observation and it tries to find the line that will minimize this value therefore we are saying that the O tries to find the best fitting straight line such that it minimizes the sum of squared residuals we have discussed this model when we were talking about this model mainly from the perspective of causal analysis in order to identify features that have a statistically significant impact on the response variable but linear regression can also be used as a prediction model for modeling linear relationship so let's refresh our memory with the definition of linear regression model by definition linear regression is a statistical or a machine learning method that can help to modrow the impact of a unit change in a variable the independent variable on the values of another Target variable the dependent variable when the relationship between two variables is linear we also discussed how mathematically we can express what we call Simple linear regression and a multiple linear regression so this how the uh simple linear regression can be represented so uh in case of simple linear regression you might recorde that we are dealing with just a single independent variable and we always have just one dependent variable both in the single linear regression and in the multiple linear regression so here you can see that Yi is equal to Beta 0 plus beta 1 * XI plus UI where Y is the dependent variable and I is basically the index of each observation or the row and then the beta 0 is The Intercept which is also known as constant and then the beta 1 is the slope coefficient or a parameter corresponding to the independent variable X which is unnown and a constant which want to estimate along to the beta zero and then the XI is the independent variable corresponding to the observation I and then finally the UI is the error term corresponding to the observation I do keep in mind that this error term we are adding because we do know that we always are going to make a mistake and we can never perfectly estimate the dependent variable therefore to account for this mistake we are adding this UI so let's also recall the estimation technique that we use to estimate the parameter of the linear regression model so the beta 0 and beta 1 and to predict the response variable so we call this estimation technique ORS or the ordinary Le squares NS is an estimation technique for estimating the unknown parameters in the linear regression model to predict the response or the dependent variable so we need to estimate the beta Z so we need to get the beta zero head and we need to estimate the beta one or the beta 1 head in order to obtain the Y I head so Yi head is equal to Beta Z head plus beta 1 head time x i where the um difference between the Yi head and the Yi so the true value of the dependent variable and the predicted value they are different will then produce our estimate of the error or what we also call residual the main idea behind this approach is to find the best fitting straight line so the regression line through a set of paired X and Y values by minimizing the sum of squared residuales so we want to minimize our errors as much as possible therefore we are taking their squared version and we are trying to sum them up and we want to minimize this entire error so to minimize the sum of squar residual so the difference between the observed dependent variable and its values predicted by the linear function of the independent variables we need to use the OLS one of the most common questions related to linear regression that comes time and time again in the uh data science related interviews is a topic of the Assumption of the linear regression model so you need to know each of these five fundamental assumptions of the linear regression and the OLS and also you need to know how to test whether each of these assumptions are satisfied so the first assumption is the linearity Assumption which states that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear we also say that the model is linear in parameters you can also check whether the linearity assumption is Satisfied by plotting the residuals to the fitted values if the pattern is not linear then the estimat will be biased in this case we say that the linearity assumption is violated and we need to use more flexible models such as tree based models that we will discuss in a bit that are able to model these nonlinear relationships the second assumption in the linear regression is the Assumption about randomness of the sample which means that the data is randomly sampled and which basically means that the errors or the residuales of the different observations in the data are independent of each other you can also check whether the second assumption so this assumption about random sample is Satisfied by plotting the residuals you can then check whether the mean of this residuales is around zero and if not then the OLS estimate will be biased and the second assumption is violated this means that you are systematically over or under predicting the dependent variable the third assumption is the exogeneity Assumption which is a really important assumption often as during the data science interviews exogeneity means that each independent variable is uncorrelated with the error terms exogeneity refers to the assumption that the independent variables are not affected by the error term in the model in other words the independent variables are assumed to be determined independently of the erors in the model exogeneity is a key Assumption of the new regression model as it allows us to interpret the estimated coefficient as representing the true causal effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable if the independent variables are not exogeneous then the estimated coefficients may be biased and the interpretation of the results may be invalid in this case we call this problem an endogeneity problem and we say that the independent variable is not exogeneous but it's endogeneous it's important to carefully consider the exogeneity Assumption when building a linear regression model as violation of this assumption can lead to invalid or misleading results if this assumption is satisfied for an independent variable in the linear model we call this independent variable exogeneous so otherwise we call it endogeneous and we say that we have a problem of endogenity endogenity refers to the situation in which the independent variables in the linear regression model are correlated with the error terms in the model in other words the errors are not independent of the independent variables endogeneity is a violation of one of the key assumptions of the linear regression model which is that the independent variables are EX geners or not affected by the errors in the model endogenity can arise in a number of ways for example it can be caused by omitted variable bias in which an important predictor of the dependent variable is not included in the model it can also be caused by the reverse causality in which the dependent variable affects the independent variable so those two are a very popular examples of the case when we can get an endogenity problem and those are things that you should know whenever you are interest in for data science roles especially when it's related to machine learning because those questions are uh being asked to you in order to test whether you understand the concept of exogeneity versus endogenity and also in which cases you can get endogenity and also how you can solve it so uh in case of omitted variable bias let's say you are estimating a person's salary and you are using as independent variable their education their number of years of experience and uh some other factors but you are not including for instance in your model a feature that would describe the uh intelligence of a person or uh for instance IQ of the person well given that those are a very important indicator for a person in order to perform in their uh field and this can definitely have um indirect impact on their salary not including these variables will result in omitted variable bias because this will then be uh Incorporated in your um error term and uh this can also relate to the other independent variables because then your uh IQ is also related to the um to the education that you have higher is your IQ usually higher is your education so in this way you will have an error term that includes an important variable so this is the omitted variable which is then uh correlated with your uh one of your or multiple of your independent variables include in your model so the other example other cause of the endogenity problem is the reverse causality and um what reverse causality means is basically that not only the independent variable has an impact on the dependent variable but also the dependent variable has an impact on the independent variable so there is a reverse relationship which is something that we want to avoid we want to have our features that include in our model that have only an impact on dependent variable so they are explaining the dependent variable but not the other way around because if you have the um the other way so you have the dependent variable impacting your independent variable then you will have the error term being related to this independent variable because there are some components that also Define your dependent variable so knowing the uh few examples such as those that can cause uh endogenity so they can violate the exogeneity assumption is really important then uh you can also check for the exogeneity Assumption by conducting a formal statistical test this is called house one test so this is an econometrical test that helps to understand whether you have an exogeneity uh violation or not but this is out of the scope of this course I will however include uh many resources related the exogeneity endogenity the omitted variable bias as well as the reverse cality and also how the house one test can be conducted so for that check out the interation guide where you can also find the corresponding free your resources the fourth assumption linear regression is the Assumption about homos skes homos refers to the assumption that the variance of the errors is constant across all predicted values this assumption is also known as the homogeneity of the variance homosa is an important Assumption of linear regression model as it allows us to use certain statistical techniques and make inferences about parameters of the model if the errors are not homoskedastic then the result of these techniques may be invalid or misleading if this assumption is violated then we say that we have heteroscedasticity hecticity refers to the situation in which the variance of the error terms in the linear regression model is not constant across all the predicted values so we have a variating variant in other words the Assumption of homos skas testing in that case is violated and we say we have a problem of heos heteros can be a real problem in V regression nurses because it can lead to invalid or misleading results for example the standard estimates and the confidence intervals for the parameters may be incorrect which means that also the statistical test may have incorrect type one error rates so you might recall when we were discussing the linear regression as part of the fundamental statis section of this course is that we uh looked into the output that comes from a python and we saw that we are getting uh estimates as part of the output as well as standard errors then the T Test so the student T test and then the corresponding P values and the 95% confidence intervals so whenever there is a heos problem the um coefficient might still be accurate but then the corresponding standard error the U student T Test which is based on the standard error and then the P value as well as the uh confidence intervals may not be accurate so you might get the uh good and reasonable coefficient but then you don't know how to correctly evaluate them you might end up discovering that um you might end up stating that certain uh independent variables are statistically significant because their coefficients are statistically significant since their P values are small but in the reality those P values are misleading because they are based on the wrong statistical uh test and they are based on the wrong standard errors you can check for this assumption by plotting the residual and see whether there is a funnel like graph if there's Fel like gra then you have a a constant variance but if there is not then you won't see this fenel like this shape that indicates that your variances are constant and if not then we say we have a problem of heos skos if you have a heteros system you can no longer use the OS and the linear regression and instead you need to look for other more advanced econometrical regression techniques that do not make such a strong assumption regarding the variance of your um residuals so you can for instance use the GLS the fgs the GMM and this type of solutions will um help to solve the hoscar problem and they will not make a strong assumptions regarding the variance in your model the fifth and the final assumption in linear regression is the Assumption about no perfect multicolinearity this assumption states that there are no exactly new relationships between the independent variables multicolinearity refers to the case when two or more independent variables in your linear regression model are highly correlated with each other this can be a problem because it can lead to unstable and unreliable estimate of the parameters in the model perfect multicolinearity happens when the independent variables are perfectly correlated with each other meaning that one variable can be perfectly predicted from the other ones and this can cause the estimated coefficient your linear regression model to be infinite or undefined and can lead your errors to be uh entirely misleading when making a predictions using this model if perfect multicolinearity is detected it may be necessary to remove one if not more problematic variables such that you will avoid having correlated variables in your model and even if the perfect multicolinearity is not present multicolinearity at a high level can still be a problem if the correlations between the independent variables are high in this case the estimate of the parameters may be imprecise and the model may be uh entirely misleading and will results in less reliable uh predictions so uh to test for the multicolinearity Assumption you have different solutions you have different options the first way uh you can do that is by using the uh di test De test is a formal statistical and econometrical test that will help you to identify which variables cause a problem and whether you have a perfect multicolinearity in your linear regression model you can PL heat map which will be based on the uh correlation metrix corresponding to your features then you will have your uh correlations per pair of independent variables plotted as a part of your heat map and then you can identify all the um pair of features that are highly correlated with each other and those are problematic features one of which should be removed from your model and in this way by uh showing the heat map you can also showcase your stakeholders why you have remove certain variables from your model whereas explaining a Diller test is much more complex because it involves more advanced econometrics and linear uh regression um explanation so if you're wondering how you can perform this de FL test and you want to prepare the uh questions related to perfect multicolinearity as well as how you can solve the perfect multicolinearity problem in your linear regression model then head towards the interview preparation guide included in this part of of the course in order to answer such questions and also to see the 30 most popular interview questions you can expect from this section in the interview preparation guide now let's look into an example coming from the linear regression in order to see how all those pieces of the puzzle come together so let's say we have collected a data on a class size and a test course for of students and we want to model the linear relationship between the class size and the test course using the linear regression model so as we have just one independent variable we are dealing with a simple linear regession and the model equation would be as follows so you can see that the test course is equal to beta0 plus beta 1 multip by class size plus Epsilon so here the class size is the single independent variable that we got in our model the test score is the dependent variable the beta0 is is The Intercept or the constant the beta one is the coefficient of Interest as this the coefficient corresponding to our independent variable and this will help us to understand what is the uh impact of a unit change in the class size on the test score and then finally we are including in our model our error term to account for the mistakes that we are definitely going to make when estimating the uh dependent variable that has course the goal is to estimate the coefficient 0 and beta 1 from the data and use the estimated model to predict the test course based on the class size so once we have the estimates we can then interpret them as follows the Y intercept the beta zero represents the expected test course when the class size is zero it represents the base score that the student would have obtained if the class size would have been zero then the coefficient for the class size the beta one represents the change in the test course associated with the one unit change in the class size the positive coefficient would imply that one unit change in the class size would increase the test course whereas the negative coefficient would uh imply that the one unit change in the class size will decrease the test course uh correspondingly we can then use this model with OLS estimate in order to predict the test course for any given class size so let's go ahead and Implement that in Python if you're wondering how this can be done then head towards the resources section as as well as the part of the Python for data science where you can learn more about how to work with pendant data frames how to import the data as well as how to fit a linear regression model so the problem is as follows we have collected data on the class size and we have this independent variable so as you can see here we have the students uncore data and then we have the class size and this our feature and then we want to estimate the Y which is the test SC so uh here is the code a sample code that will fit a linear regression model we are keeping here everything very simple we are not splitting our data into training test and then fitting the model on the training data and making the predictions with the test score but we just want to see how we can interpret the uh coefficients so keeping everything very simple so you can see here that we are getting an intercept equal to 63.7 and the coefficient corresponding to our single independent variable class size is equal to minus 0.40 what this means is that so each increase of the uh class size by one unit will result in the decrease of the test scores with 0.4 so there is a negative relationship between the two now the next question is whether there is a statistical significance whether the uh coefficient is actually significant and where the class size has actually statistically significant imp impact on the dependent variable but all those are things that we have discussed as part of the fundamental statistic section of this course as well as we are going to look into a linear regression example when we are going to discuss the hypothesis testing so I would highly suggest you to uh stop in here to revisit the fundamentals to statistic section of this course to refresh your memory in terms of linear regression and then um check also the hypothesis test uh section of the course in order to look into a specific example of linear regression when we are discussing the standard errors how you can evaluate your OLS estimation results how you can use the student T Test the P value and the confidence intervals and how you can estimate them in this way you will learn for now only the theory related to the coefficients and then you can um add on the top of this Theory once you have learned all the other sections and the other topics in this course let's finally discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of the linear regression model so some of the advantages of the linear regression model are the following the linear regression is relatively simple and easy to understand and to implement linear regression models are well suited for understanding the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable also linear regression can help to handle multiple independent variables and can estimate the unique relationship between each independent variable and the corresponding dependent variable thear regression model can also be extended to handle more complex models such as pooms interaction terms allowing for more flexibility in the modeling the data also linear aggression model can be easily regularized to prevent overfitting which is a common problem in modeling as we saw uh in the beginning of this section so you can use for instance retrogression which is an extension of Vue regression you can use ler regression which is also an extension of Vue regression model and then finally linear regression models are widely supported by software packages and libraries making it easy to implement and to analyze and some of the disadvantages of the linear aggression are the following so the linear aggression models make a lot of strong assumptions regarding for instance the linearity between independent variables and independent variables while the true relationship can actually be also nonlinear so the model will not then be able to capture the complexity of the data so nonlinearity and the predictions will be inaccurate therefore it's really important to have a data that has a linear relationship for linear regression to work linear regression also assumes that the error terms are normally distributed and also homoskedastic error terms are independent across observations violations of the strong assumption will lead to bias and inefficient estimates linear regression is also sensitive to outliers which can have a disproportionate effect on the estimate of the regression coefficients linear regression does not easily handle categorical independent variables which often require additional data preparation or the use of indicator variables or using encodings finally linear regression also assumes that the independent variables are exogeneous and not affected by the error terms if this assumption is violated then the result of the model may be misleading in this lecture lecture number five we will discuss another simple machine learning technique called logistic regression which is simple but very important classification model useful when dealing with a problem where the output should be a probability so the name regression in logistic regression might be confusing since this is actually a classification model logistic regression is widely used in a variety of fields such as social sciences medicine and Engineering so let us firstly Define the logistic regression model the logistic regression is a supervised classification technique that models the conditional probability of an event occurring or observation belonging to a certain class given a data set of independent variables and those are our features the class can have two categories or more but later on we will learn that logistic regression Works ideally when we have just two classes this is is another very important and very popular machine learning technique which though named regression is actually a supervised classification technique so when the relationship between two variables is linear the dependent variable is a categorical variable and you want to predict a variable in the form of a probability so a number between zero and one then logistic regression comes in very handy this is because during the prediction process in logistic regression the classifier predicts the probability ility a value between Z and one of each observation belonging to a certain class for instance if you want to predict the probability or the likelihood of a candidate being elected or Not Elected during the election process given the set of characteristics that you got about your candidate let's say the popularity score the past successes and other descriptive variables about this candidate then logistic regression comes in very handy to model this probability so rather than predicting the response variable logistic regression models the probability that y belongs to a particular category similar to the linear regression with a difference that instead of Y it predicts the log odds so we will come about this definition of log odds and odds in a bit in statistical terminology what we are trying to do is to model the conditional distribution of the response y given the predictors X therefore logistic regression helps to predict the probability of Y belonging to a certain class given the feature space what we call probability of Y given X if you're wondering what is the concept of probability what is this conditional probability then make sure to head towards the section of fundamentals to statistics as we are going to in detail about this Concepts as well as we are looking into different examples these definitions and this Concepts will help you to better follow this lecture so here we see the probability X which is what we are interested in modeling and it's equal to e to the power beta 0 + beta 1 * x / to 1 + e^ beta 0 + beta 1 * X let's now look into the formulas for the odds and log ODS both these formulas are really important because you can expect them during your data science interviews so sometimes you will be asked to explicitly write down the odds and log ODS formulas and those are highly related to the log likelihood and likelihood functions which are the base for the estimation technique mle or the maximum likelihood estimation used to estimate the unknown parameters in the logistic agression so the log odds and the odds are highly related to each other and in logistic regression we use the odds and log ODS to describe the probability of an event occurring the odds is a ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring so as you can see the odd is equal to PX / to 1 - PX where PX is the probability of event occurring and 1 - PX is the probability of the event not occurring so this formula is equal to E power beta 0 + beta 1 * X in our formula where we only have one independent variable and the E simply is the ERS number or the 2.72 which is a constant so we won't derive this formula by ourselves because that's out of the scope of this course but feel free to head out to the PX formula that we just saw in the previous slide and take this formula divide it to one minus 2 exactly the same expression and you can verify that you will end up with this expression that you see here for example if the probability of a person having a heart attack is 0.2 then the ads of having a heart attack will be 0.2 / to 1 - 0.2 which is equal to 0.25 the low OD also known as the logit function is a natural logarithm of the OD so as you can see here the log of px/ to 1 minus PX and this is equal to Beta 0 plus beta 1 * X so you can see that we are getting rid of this e and this is simply because of a mathematical expression that says if we take the log of the e to the power something then we end up with only the exponent part in it though this is out of the scope of this course to look into the mathematical derivation of this formula I will include many resources regarding this logarithm the Transformations and the mathematics behind it just in case you want to look into those details and do some uh extra learning so logistic regression uses the log ODS as the dependent variable and the independent variables are used to predict this log ODS the coefficient of the independent varibles represent then the change in the log OD for a one unit change in the independent variable so you might that in the linear regression we were modeling the actual dependent variable in case of logistic regression the difference is that we are modeling the logas another important Concept in logistic regression is the likelihood function the likelihood function is used to estimate the parameters of the model given the observed data sometimes during the interviews you might also be asked to write down the exact likelihood formula or the log likelihood function so I would definitely suggest you to memorize this one and to understand all the components included in this formula the likelihood function describes the probability of The observed data given the parameters of the model and if you follow the lecture of the probability density functions in the section of fundamentals to statistics you might here even recognize the bar noly PDF since the likelihood function here is based on the probability Mass function of a Baro distribution which is a distribution of a binary outcome So This is highly applicable to the case where we have only two categories in our dependent variable and we are trying to estimate the probability of observation to belonging to one of those two classes so this is the L likelihood function and this is the likelihood function we start with the likelihood function and the L the capital letter L stands for the likelihood function the L is equal the likelihood function L is equal to product across all pair of these multipliers so we have Peak side to the power Yi multiplied by 1 - pxi to^ 1 - y i where pxi is the PX that we just so only for observation I and the Yi is simply the class so Yi will either be equal to zero or one so Yi is equal to 1 then 1 minus Yi is equal to zero so we every time we are looking into the probability of observation belonging to the first class multiply by the probability of observation not belonging to that plus and we take this cross multiplications and we do that for all the observations that are included in our data and this also comes from mathematics so this stands for the product so uh given that it's harder to work with products compared to the sums we then apply the Lo likelihood uh transformation in order to obtain the Lo likelihood function instead of likelihood function so when we apply this log transformation so we take the L logarithm of this expression we end up with this log likelihood expression and here again one more time we are making use of a mathematical property which says that if we take the logarithm of the products we end up with the sum of the logarithms so we go from the products to the sums I will also include resources regarding that such that you can also learn the mathematics Behind These Transformations so the L likelihood with a lowercase L is equal to logarithm of the products p i^ y i * 1 - PX i^ 1 - Yi and when we apply that mathematical transformation then the L is equal to sum across all observation I is equal to 1 till M and then y i so the power the exponent comes to the front Yi * logarithm of the pxi plus 1 - Yi * logarithm of 1 - pxi while for linear regression we use OLS as estimation technique for logis regression in other estimation technique should be used the reason why we cannot use OLS in logistic regression to find the best fitting line is because the errors can become very large or very small and sometimes even negative in case of logistic aggression while for logistic regression we aim for predicted value between zero and one therefore for logistic regression we need to use estimation technique called maximum likelihood estimation or in short mle where the likelihood function calculates the probability of observing the data outcome given the input data in the model we just saw the likel function in the previous slide this function is then optimized to find the set of parameters that result in the largest sum likelihood so the maximum likelihood over the training data set logistic function will always produce this s-shaped curve regardless of the value of independent variable able X resulting in sensible estimation most of the time so value between 0 and one so as you can see this s-shaped cure is what characterizes the maximum likelihood estimation corresponding to the logistic regression and it will always provide not come between zero and one then the idea behind the maximum likelihood estimation is to find a set of estimates that would maximize the likelihood function so let's go through the maximum likelihood estimation step by step what we need to do first is to define a likelihood function the first step is to always Define this function for the model secondly we need to write the log likelihood function so the next step is to take the natural logarithm of the likelihood function to obtain the log likelihood function so I'm talking about this one the L likel function is a more convenient and computationally efficient function to work with and what we need to do next is to find the maximum of this L like function so this step consists of finding the values of the parameters beta 0 and beta 1 that maximize the L lik function there are many optimization algorithms that can be used to find the maximum but these are out of the scope of this course and you don't need to know them as part of becoming a data scientist and entering data science field in the fourth step we need to estimate the parameters so we are talking about the beta 0 and beta 1 once the maximum of the log likel function is found the values of the parameters that correspond to the maximum are considered the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters and then in the next step we need to check the model Feit so once the maximum likelihood estimates are obtained we can check the goodness of fit of the model by calculating information criteria such as AIC B Bic or R squ where AIC stands for akas information criteria Bic stands for bi information criteria and r s refers to the same evaluation value that we use for evaluating linear regression in the final step we need to make predictions and evaluate the model using the maximum likelihood estimates the model can be used to make predictions on a new unseen data and the performance of the model can be then evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy precision and recall those are metrics that we have Revisited as part of the very initial lecture in the section and those are metrics that you need to know so unlike the AIC Bic that we just spoke about that evaluates the goodness of feed of the very initial estimates that come from the maximum likelihood the accuracy and precision and the recall evaluate the final model so the values that we get for the nuan in data when we make the predictions and we get the classes and those are metrics that you need to know if you're wondering what this accuracy is what this Precision recall is as well as the F1 score make sure to head towards the very initial lecture in this section where we talked about the exact definition of this metrix let's finally discuss the advantages and the disadvantages of the logistic regression so some of the advantages of logistic regressions are that it's a simple model it has a low variance it has a low bias and it provides probabilities some of the disadvantages of logistic regressions are logistic regression is unable to model nonlinear relationship so one of the key assumptions that logistic regression is making is that there is a linear relationship between your independent variable and your dependent variable logistic regression is also unstable when your classes are well separable as well logistic agression becomes very unstable when you have more than two classes so this means whenever you have more than two categories in your dependent variable or whenever your classes are well separable using logistic regression for classification purposes will not be very smart so instead you should look for other models that you can use for this task and one of such models is linear discriminate analysis so the LDA that we will introduce in the next lecture so this is all for this lecture where we have looked into the logistic regression and the maximum likelihood estimation in the next lecture we will look into the LDA so stay tuned and I will see you in the next lecture looking to step into machine learning or data science it's about starting somewhere practical yet powerful and as the simple yet most popular machine learning algorithm linear regression linear aggression isn't just a jargon it's a tool that is used both for a finding out what are the most important features in your data as well as being used to forecast the future that's your starting point in the Journey of data science and Hands-On machine learning uh work embark on a handson data science and machine learning project where we are going to find what are the drivers of Californian house prices you will clean the data visualize the key trends you will learn how to process your data and how to use different python libraries to understand what are those drivers of Californian house values you're are going to learn how to implement linear regression in Python and learn all these fundamental steps that you need in order to conduct a proper handson data science project at the end of this project you will not only learn those different python libraries when it comes to data science and machine learning such as pandas psyit learn tou models medf Le curn but you will also be able to put this project on your person website and on your resume a point size stepbystep case study and approach to build your confidence and expertise in machine learning and in data science in this part we are going to talk about a case study in the field of Predictive Analytics and causal analysis so we are going to use this simple yet powerful regression technique called your regression in order to perform causal analysis and Predictive Analytics so by causal analysis I mean that we are going to look into this correlations clation and we're trying to figure out what are the features that have an impact on the housing price on the house value so what are these features that are describing the house that Define and cause the variation in the uh house prices the goal of this case study is to uh practice linear regression model and to get this first feeling of how uh you can use a machine learning model a simple machine learning model in order to perform uh model training model evaluation and also use it for causal analysis where you are trying to identify features that have a statistically significant impact on your response variable so on your dependent variable so here is the step-by-step process that we are going to follow in order to find out what are the features that Define the Californian house values so first we are going to understand what are the set of independent variables that we have we're also going to understand what is the response variable that we have so for our multiple linear regression model we are going to understand what are this uh techniques that we uh need and what are the libraries in Python that we need to load in order to be able to conduct this case study so first we are going to load all these libraries and we are going to understand why we need them then we are going to conduct data loading and data preprocessing this is a very important step and I deliberately didn't want you to skip this and didn't want you to give you the clean data cuz uh usually in normal real Hands-On data science job you won't get a clean data you will get a dirty data which will contain missing values which will contain outliers and those are things that you need to handle before you proceed to the actual and F part which is the modeling and the uh analysis so therefore we are going to do missing data analysis we are going to remove the missing data from our Californian house price data we are going to conduct outlier detection so we are going to identify outliers we are going to learn different techniques that you can use visualization uh techniques uh in Python that you can use in order to identify outliers and then remove them from your data then we are going to perform data visualization so we are going to explore the data and we are going to do different plots to learn more about the data to learn more about this outliers and different statistical techniques uh combined with python so then we are going to do correlation analysis to identify some problematic features which is something that I would suggest you to do independent the nature of your case study to understand understand what kind of variables you have what is the relationship between them and whether you are dealing with some potentially problematic variables so then we will be uh moving towards the fun part which is performing the uh multiple theine regression in order to perform the caal NES which means identifying the features in the Californian house blocks that Define the value of the Californian houses so uh finally we will do very quickly another uh implementation of the same multiple uh multiple linear regression in order to uh give you not only one but two different ways of conducting linear regression because linear regression can be used not only for caal analysis but also as a standalone a common machine learning regression type of model therefore I will also tell you how you can use psych learn as a second way of training and then predicting the C for house values so without further Ado let's get started once you become a DAT a scientist or machine learning researcher or machine learning engineer there will be some cases some Hands-On uh data science projects where the business will come to you and we'll tell you well here we have this data and we want to understand what are these features that have the biggest influence on this Auto factor in this specific case in our case study um let's assume we have a client that uh is interested in identifying what are the features that uh Define the house price so maybe it's someone who wants to um uh invest in uh houses so it's someone who is interested in buying houses and maybe even renovating them and then reselling them and making a profit in that way or maybe in the long-term uh investment Market when uh people are buying real estate in a way of uh in inting in it and then longing for uh holding it for a long time and then uh selling it later or for some other purposes the end goal in this specific case uh for a person is to identify what are this features of the house that makes this house um to be priced at a certain level so what are the features of the house that are causing the price and the value of the house so we are going to make use of this very popular data set that is available on kagal and it's originally coming from psyit learn and is called California housing prices I'll also make sure to put the link uh of this uh specific um data set uh both in my GitHub account uh under this repository that will be dedicated for this specific case study as well as um I will also point out the additional links that you can use to learn more about this data set so uh this data set is derived from 1990 um US Census so United uh States census using one row Paris sensus block so a Blog group or block is the smallest uh geographical unit for which the US cus Bureau publishes sample data so a Blog group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people who are living there so a household is a group of people residing with within a single home uh since the average number of rooms and bedrooms in this data set are provided per household this conss may be um May take surprisingly large values for blog groups with few households and many empty houses such as Vacation Resorts so um let's now look into uh the variables that are available in this specific data set so uh what we have here is the med Inc which is the median income in blog group so uh this um touches the uh financial side and uh Financial level of the uh block uh block of households then we have House age so this is the median house age in the block group uh then we have average rooms which is the average number of rooms uh per household and then we have average bedroom which is the average number of bedrooms per household then we have population which is the uh blog group population so that's basically like we just saw that's the number of people who live in that block then we have a uh o OU uh which is basically the average number of household members uh then we have latitude and longitude which are the latitude and longitude of this uh block group that we are looking into so as you can see here we are dealing with aggregate data so we don't have the uh the data per household but rather the data is calculated and average aggregated based on a block so this very common in data science uh when we uh want to reduce the dimension of the data and when we want to have some sensible numbers and create this crosssection data and uh cross-section data means that we have multiple observations for which we have data on a single time period period in this case we are using as an aggregation unit the block and uh we have already learned as part of the uh Theory lectures this idea of median so we have seen that there are different descriptive measures that we can use in order to aggregate our data one of them is the mean but the other one is the median and often times especially if we are dealing with skute distribution so if we have a distribution that is not symmetric but it's rather right cuute or left skewed then we need to use this idea of median because median is then better representation of this um uh scale of the data um compared to the mean and um in this case we will soon see when representing and visualizing this data that we are indeed dealing with a skewed data so um this basically a very simple a very basic data set with not too many features so great um way to uh get your hands uh uh on with actual machine learning use case uh we will be keeping it simple but yet we will be learning the basics and the fundamentals uh in a very good way such that uh learning more um difficult and more advanced machine learning models will be much more easier for you so let's now get into the actual coding part so uh here I will be using the Google clap so I will be sharing the link to this notebook uh combined with the data in my python for data science repository and you can make use of it in order to uh follow this uh tutorial uh with me so uh we always start with importing uh libraries we can run a l regression uh manually without using libraries by using matrix multiplication uh but I would suggest you not to do that you can do it for fun or to understand this metrix multiplication the linear algebra behind the linear regression but uh if you want to um get handson and uh understand how you can use the new regression like you expect to do it on your day-to-day job then you expect to use um instead libraries such as psychic learn or you can also use the statsmodels.api libraries in order to understand uh this topic and also to get handson I decided to uh showcase this example not only in one library in Cy thir but also the starts models and uh the reason for this is because many people use linear regression uh just for Predictive Analytics and for that using psyit learn this is the go-to option but um if you want to use linear regression for causal analysis so to identify and interpret this uh features the independent variables that have a statistically significant impact on your response variable and then you will need to uh use another Library a very handy one for linear regression which is called uh stats models. API and from there you need to import the SM uh functionality and this will help you to do exactly that so later on we will see how nicely this Library will provide you the outcome exactly like you will learn on your uh traditional econometrics or introduction to linear regression uh class so I'm going to give you all this background information like no one before and we're going to interpret and learn everything such that um you start your machine Learning Journey in a very proper and uh in a very um uh high quality way so uh in this case uh first thing we are going to import is the pendence library so we are importing pendis Library as PD and then non pile Library as NP we are going to need pendes uh just to uh create a pendis data frame to read the data and then to perform data wrangling to identify the missing data outliers so common data wrangling and data prosessing steps and then we are going to use npy and npy is a common way to uh use whenever you are visualizing data or whenever you are dealing with metrices or with arrays so pandas and nonp are being used interchangeably so then we are going to use meth plot lip and specifically the PIP plat from it uh and this library is very important um when you want to visualize a data uh then we have cburn um which uh is another handy data visualization library in Python so whenever you want to visualize data in Python then methot leip and Cy uh cburn there are two uh very handy data visualization techniques that you must know if you like this um cooler undertone of colors the Seaburn will be your go-to option because then the visualizations that you are creating are much more appealing compared to the med plot Le but the underlying way of working so plotting scatter plot or lines or um heat map they are the same so then we have the STS mods. API uh which is the library from which we will be importing the uh as uh that is the temple uh linear regression model that we will be using uh for our caal analysis uh here I'm also importing the uh from Psychic learn um linear model and specifically the linear regression model and um this one uh is basically similar to this one you can uh use both of them but um it is a common um way of working with machine learning model so whenever you are dealing with Predictive Analytics so we you are using the data not for uh identifying features that have a statistically significant impact on the response variable so features that have an influence and are causing the dependent variable but rather you are just interested to use the data to train the model on this data and then um test it on an unseen data then uh you can use pyit learn so psyit learn will uh will be something that you will be using not only for linear regression but also for a machine learning model I think of uh Canon um logistic regression um random Forest decision trees um boosting techniques such as light GBM GBM um also clustering techniques like K means DB scan anything that you can think of uh that fits in in this category of traditional machine learning model you will be able to find Ayler therefore I didn't want you to limit this tutorial only to the S models which we could do uh if we wanted to use um if we wanted to have this case study for uh specifically for linear regression which we are doing but instead I wanted to Showcase also this usage of psychic learn because pyic learn is something that you can use Beyond linear regression so for all these added type of machine learning models and given that this course is designed to introduce you to the world of machine learning I thought that we will combine this uh also with psychic learning something that you are going to see time and time again when you are uh using python combined with machine learning so then I'm also uh importing the uh training test plate uh from the psychic learn model selection such that we can uh split our data into train and test now uh before we move into uh the uh actual training and testing we need to first load our data so so therefore uh what I did was to uh here uh in this sample data so in a folder in Google collab I uh put it this housing. CSV data that's the data that you can download uh when you go to this specific uh page so uh when you go here um then uh you can also uh download here that data so download 49 kab of this uh housing data and that's exactly what I'm uh downloading and then uploading here in Google clap so this housing. CSV in this folder so I'm copying the path and I'm putting it here and I'm creating a variable that holds this um name so the path of the data so the file uncore path is the variable string variable that holds the path of the data and then what I need to do is that I need to uh take this file uncore path and and I need to put it in the pd. read CSV uh which is a function that we can use in order to uh load data so PD stands for pandas the short way of uh naming pandas uh PD do and then read uncore CSV is the function that we are taking from Panda's library and then within the parentheses we are putting the file uncore path if you want to learn more about this Basics or variable different data structures some basic python for data science then um to ensure that we are keeping this specific tutorial structured I will not be talking about that but feel free to check the python for data science course and I will put the link um in the comments below such that you can uh learn that if you don't know yet and then you can come back to this tutorial to learn how you can use python in combination with linear regression so uh the first thing that I tend to do before moving on to the the actual execution stage is to um look into the data to perform data exploration so what I tend to do is to look at the data field so the name of the variables that are available in the data and that you can do by doing data. columns so you will then look into the columns in your data this will be the name of your uh uh data fields so let's go ahead and do command enter so we see that we have longitude like attitude housing unor median age we have total rooms we have total bedrooms population so basically the the um amount of people who are living in the in those households and in those houses then we have households then we have median income we have median housecore value and we have ocean proximity now you might notice that the name of these variables are a bit different than in the actual um documentation of the California house so you see here the naming is different but the underlying uh explanation is the same so here they are just trying to make it uh nicer and uh represent it in a better uh naming but uh it is a common um thing to see in Python when we are dealing with uh data that uh we have this underscores in the name approvation so we have housing uncore median AG which in this case you can see that it says house um age so bit different but their meaning is the same this is still the median house age in the block group so uh one thing uh that you can also uh notice here is that the um in the official uh documentation we don't have this um one extra variable that we have here which is the ocean proximity and this basically uh describes the uh Clos cless of the house from the ocean which of course uh for some people can definitely mean a increase or decrease in the house price so I basically um we have all these variables and next thing that I tend to do is to look into the actual data and one thing that we can do is just to look at the um top 10 rows of the data instead of printing the entire uh data frame so when we go and uh execute this specific part of the code and the command you can see that here we have the top 10 rows uh of our data so we have the longitude the latitude we have the housing median age you can see we are see some 41 year 21 year 52 year basically the number of years that a house the median age of the house is 41 21 52 and this is per block then we have the number of total bedrooms so we see that uh we have um in this blog uh the total number of rooms that this houses have is 7,99 so we are already seeing a data that consists of these large numbers which is something to take into account when uh you are dealing with machine learning models and especially with line regression then we have total bedrooms um and we have then population households median income median house value and the ocean proximity one thing that you can see right of the bed is that uh we have longitude and latitude uh which have some uh unique uh characteristics um and longitude is with minuses latitude is with pluses uh but that's fine for the linear regression because what it is basically looking is uh whether a variation in certain independent variables in this case longitude and latitude but that will cause a change in the dependent variable so just to refresh our memory what this linear regression will do in this case um so we are dealing with multiple inine regression because we have more than one independent variables so we have as independent variables those different features that describe the house except of the house price because median house value is the dependent variable so that's basically what we are trying to figure out we want to see what are the features of the house that cause so Define the house price we want to identify what are um the features that cause a change in our dependent variable and specifically uh what is the uh change in our median house price uh volue if we apply a one unit change in our independent feature so if we have a multiple linear regession we have learned during the theory lecture that what linear regression tries to use during causal analysis is that it tries to keep all the independent variables constant and then investigate for a specific independent variable what is this one unit uh change uh increase uh in the specific independent variable will result in what kind of change in our dependent variable so if we for instance change by one unit our uh housing median age um then what will be the correspond in change in our median household value keeping everything else concent so that's basically the idea behind multi multiple linear regression and using that for this specific use case and in here um what we also want to do is to find out what are the uh data types and whether we can learn bit more about our data before proceeding to the next step and for that I tend to use this uh info uh function in panel so given that the data is a penis data frame I will just do data. info and then parentheses and then this will uh show us what is the data type and what is the number of new values per variable so um as we have already noticed from this header which we can also see here being confirmed that ocean proximity is a variable that is not a numeric value so here you can see nearby um also a value for that variable which unlike all the other values is represented by a string so this is something that we need to take into account because later on when we uh will be doing the data prop processing and we will actually uh actually run this model we will need to do something with this specific variable we need to process it so um for the rest we are dealing with numeric variables so you can see here that longitude latitude or all the other variables including our dependent variable is a numeric variable so float 64 the only variable that needs to be taken care of is this ocean uncore proximity uh which um we can actually later on also see that is um categorical string variable and what this basically means is that it has these different categories so um for instance uh let us actually do that in here very quickly so let's see what are all the unique values for this variable so if we take the name of this variable so we copied from this overview in here and we do unique then this should give us the unique values for this categorical variable so here we go so we have actually five different unique values for this categorical string variable so this means that this ocean proximity can take uh five different values and it can be either near Bay it can be less than 1 hour from the ocean it can be Inland it can be near Ocean and it can be uh in the Iceland what this means is that we are dealing with a feature that describes the distance uh of the block from the ocean and here the underlying idea is that maybe this specific feature has a statistically significant impact on the house value meaning that it might be possible that for some people um in certain areas or in certain countries living in the uh nearby the ocean uh will be increasing the value of the house so if there is a huge demand for houses which are near the ocean so people prefer to uh leave near the ocean then most likely there will be a positive relationship if there is a uh negative relationship then it means that uh people uh if uh in that area in California for instance people do not prefer to live near the ocean then uh we will see this negative relationship so we can see that um if we increase uh the uh if if people uh if the house is in the uh um area that is uh not close to Ocean so further from the ocean then the house value will be higher so this is something that we want to figure out with this line regression we want to understand what are the features that uh Define the value of the house and we can say that um if the house has those characteristics then most likely the house price will be higher or the house price will be lower and uh linear aggression helps us to not only understand what are those features but also to understand how much higher or how much lower will be the value of the house if we have the certain characteristics and if we increase the certain characteristics by one unit so next we are going to look into uh the missing data in our data so in order to have a proper machine learning model we need to do some uh data processing so for that what we need to do is we need to check for the uh missing values in our data and we need to understand what is this amount of new values per data field and this will help us to understand whether uh we can uh remove some of those missing values or we need to do imputation so depending on the amount of missing data that we got in our data we can then understand which all those Solutions we need to take so here we can see that uh we don't have any n values when it comes to longitude latitude housing median age and all the other variables except of one variable one independent variable and that's the total bedrooms so we can see that um out of all the observations that we got the total uh underscore bedrooms variable has 207 cases when we do not have the corresponding uh information so when it comes to representing this numbers in percentages which is something that you should do as your next step we can see that um out of uh the entire data set uh for total underscore bedrooms variable um only 1. n n uh 3% is missing now this is really important because by simply looking at the number of times the uh number of missing uh observations perir data field this won't be helpful for you because you will not be able to understand relatively how much of the data is missing now if you have for a certain variable 50% missing or 80% missing then it means that for majority of your house blocks you don't have that information and including that will not be beneficial for your Morel nor will be it accurate to include it and it will result in biased uh Morel because if you have for the majority of observations uh no information and for certain observations you do that inform you have that information then you will automatically skew your results and you will have biased results therefore if you have uh for the majority of your um data set that specific uh variable missing then I would suggest you choose just to drop that independent variable in this case we have just one uh% uh of the uh house blocks missing that information which means that this gives me confidence that uh I would rather keep this independent variable and just to drop those observations that do not have a total uh underscore bedrooms uh information now another solution could also be is uh to instead of dropping that entire independent variable is just to uh use some sort of imputation technique so uh what this means is that uh we will uh try to find a way to systematically find a replacement for that missing value so we can use mean imputation median imput ation or more model based more advanced statistical or econometrical approaches to perform imputation so for now this out of the scope of this problem but I would say look at the uh percentage of uh observations that for which this uh independent variable has missing uh values if this is uh low like less than 10% and you have a large data set then uh you should uh be comfortable dropping those observations but if you have a small data set so you got only 100 observations and for them like 20% or 40% is missing then consider from imputation so try to find the values that can be um used in order to replace those missing values now uh once we have this information and we have identified the missing values the next thing is to uh clean the data so here what I'm doing is that I'm using the data that we got and I'm using the function drop na which means drop the um uh observations where the uh value is missing so I'm dropping all the observations for which the total underscore bedrooms has a null value so I'm getting rid of my missing observations so after doing that I'm checking whether I got rid of my missing observations and you can see here that when I'm printing data do is n do sum so I'm summing up the number of uh Missing observations no values per uh variable then uh now I no longer have any missing observations so I successfully deleted all the missing observations now the next state is to describe the data uh through some descriptive statistics and through data visualization so before moving on towards the caal analysis or predictive analysis in any sort of machine learning traditional machine learning approach try to First Look Into the data try to understand the data and see uh whether you are seeing some patterns uh what is the mean uh of different um numeric data fields uh do you have certain uh categorical values that cause an un unbalanced data those are things that you can discover uh early on uh before moving on to uh the model training and testing and blindly believing to the numbers so data visualization techniques and data exploration are great way to understand uh this uh data that you got before using that uh in order to train in t machine learning model so here I'm using the uh traditional describe function of pendas so data. describe parentheses and then this will give me the descriptive statistics of my data so here what we can see is that in total we got uh 20 , 640 observations uh and then uh we also have a mean of uh all the variables so you can see that per variable I have the same count which basically means that for all variables I have the same number of rows and then uh here I have the mean which means that um here we have the mean of the uh variables so per variable we have their mean and then we have their standard deviation so the square root of the variance we have the minimum we have the maximum but we also have the 25th percentile the 15 percentile and the 75th percentile so the uh percentile uh and quantiles those are uh statistical terms that we oftenly use and the 25th percentile is the first quantile the 15 percentile is the second quantile or the uh median and the 75th percentile is the third quantile so uh what this basically means is that uh this percentiles help us to understand what is this threshold when it comes to looking at the um observations uh that fall under the 25% uh and then above the 25% so when we look at this uh standard deviation standard deviation helps us to interpret the variation in the data at the unit so scale of that variable so in this case the variable is median house value and we have that the mean is equal to 206 ,000 approximately so more or less that uh range 206 K and then the standard deviation is 115k what this means is that uh in the data set we will find blocks that will have the median house value that will be uh 200 uh 6K 206k plus 115k which is around 321k so there will be blocks where the median house value is around 321k and there will also be blocks where the um median house value will be around uh 91k so 206,000 minus 115k so this the idea behind standard deviation this variation your data so next we can interpret the idea of this uh minimum and the maximum of your data in your data fields the minimum will help you to understand what is this minimum value that you have per data field numeric data field and what is the maximum value so what is the range of values that you are looking into in case of the median house value this means what um are the uh what is this minimum median house value per uh block and uh in case of Maximum what is this um highest value per block when it comes to Medan house value so this can uh help you to understand um when we look at this aggregated data so the median house value what are the blocks that have the uh cheapest uh houses when it comes to their valuation and what are the most expensive uh blocks of houses so we can see that uh the cheapest um block uh where in that block the median house value is uh 15K so 14,999 and the house block with the um highest valuation when it comes to the median house value so uh the median um valuation of the houses is equal to $500,000 And1 which means that when we look at our blocks of houses um that uh the median house value in this most expensive blocks will be a maximum 500k so uh next thing that I tend to do is to visualize the data I tend to start with the dependent variable so this is the variable of interest the target variable or the response variable which is in our case the median house value so this will serve us as our dependent variable and what I want you to do is to upload this histogram uh in order to understand what is the distribution of median house values so I want to see that when when looking at the data what are the um most frequently appearing median house values and uh what are this uh type of blocks that have um unique less frequently um appearing uh meded house values by plotting this type of plots you can see some outliers some um frequently appearing values but also some values that uh go uh and uh are lying outside of the range and this will help you to identify and learn more about your data and toid identify outliers in your data so in here I'm using the uh curn uh Library so given that earlier I already imported this libraries there is no need to import here what I'm doing is that I'm setting the the GD so which basically means that I'm saying the background should be white and I also want discrete so this means those discrete behind then I'm initializing the size of the figure so PLT this comes from met plotly P plot and then I'm setting the figure the figure size should be 10x 6 so um this is the 10 and this is the six then we have the main plot so I'm um using the uh his plot function from curn and then I'm taking from the uh clean data so from which we have removed the missing data I'm picking the uh variable of interest which is the median house value and then I'm saying upload this um histogram using the fors green color and then uh I'm saying uh the title of this figure is distribution of p and house values then um I'm also mentioning what is the X label which basically means what is the name of this variable that I'm putting on the xaxis which is a median house value and what is the Y label so what is the name of the variable that I need to put on the Y AIS and then I'm saying pl. show which means show me the figure so that's basically how in Python the visualization works we uh first need to write down the the actual uh figure size uh and then we need to uh Set uh the function uh in the right variable so provide data to the visualization then we need to put the title we need to put the X label y label and then we need to say show me the visualization and uh if you want to learn more about this visualization techniques uh make sure to check the python for data science course cuz that one will help you to understand slowly uh and in detail how you can uh visualize your data so in here what we are visualizing is the frequency of these median house values in the entire data set what this means is that we are looking at the um number of times each of those median house values appear in the data set so uh we want to understand are there uh certain uh median house values that appear very often and are there certain house values that do not appear that often so those can be may be considered outliers uh because we want in our data only to keep those uh most relevant and representative data points we want to derive conclusions that hold for the majority of our uh uh observations and not for outliers we will be then using that uh representative data in order to run our linear regression and then make conclusions when looking at this graph what we can see is that uh we have a certain cluster of um median house values that appear quite often and those are the cases when this frequency is high so you can see that uh we have for instance houses in here in all this block that appear um very often so for instance the median house value U of A about 160 170k this appears very frequently so you can see that the frequency is above 1,000 those are the most frequently appearing Medan house values and um there are cases when the um so you can see in here and you can see in here houses that uh whose median house value is not appearing very often so you can see that their frequency is low so um roughly speaking those houses they are unusual houses they can be considered as outliers and the same holds also for these houses because you can see that for those the frequency is very low which means that in our population of houses so California house prices you'll most likely see houses uh blocks of houses whose medium value is between let's say um 17K up to to uh let's say uh 300 or 350k but anything below and above this is considered as unusual so you don't often see a houses that are um so house blocks that have a median house value less than uh 70 or 60k and then uh also uh houses that are above um 370 or 400k so do consider that uh we are dealing with 1990 um a year data and not the current uh prices because nowadays uh Californian houses are much more expensive but this is the data coming from 1990 so uh do take that into account when interpreting this type of data visualizations so uh what we can then do is to use this idea of inter quantile range to remove this outl what this basically means is that we are looking at the lowest 25th uh% percentile so uh we are looking at this first quantile so 0.25 which is a 25th percentile and we are looking at this upper 25th um percent which means the third quantile or the 75th percentile and then we want to basically remove those uh by using this idea of 25th percentile and 75th percentile so the first quantile and the third quantile we can then identify what are the um uh observations so the blocks that have a median house value that is below the uh 25th per H and above the 75% he so basically we want to uh get the middle part of our data so we want to get this data for which the median house uh value is above the 25th percentile so U above all the uh median house values that is above the uh lowest 25% uh percent and then we also want to remove this very large median house values so we want to uh keep in our data the so-called normal uh and representative blocks blocks where the Medan house uh value is above the lowest 25% and smaller than the largest 25% what we are using is this statistical uh term called inter Quan range you don't need to know the name but I think it would be just work to understand it because this is a very popular way of uh making a datadriven uh removal of the outliers so I'm selecting the um 25th percentile by using the quantile function from pandas uh so I'm saying find for me the um value that divides my entire uh block of observations so block observations to observations for which the Medan house value is below the um the um 25th percentile and above the 25th percentile so what are the largest 75% and what are the smallest 25% when it comes to the median house value and we will then be removing this 25% so that I will do by using this q1 and then uh we will be using the uh Q3 in order to remove the very large median house Valu so the uh upper 25th percentile and then uh in order to um calculate the inter quanti range we need to uh pick the Q3 and subtract from it the q1 so just to understand this idea of q1 and Q3 so the Quantas better let's actually print this uh q1 and this uh Q3 so let's actually remove this part for now and they run it so as you can see here what we are finding is that the uh q1 so the 25th percentile or first quantile is equal to 19,500 so it basically is a number in here what it means is that um we have uh 25% um of the um observations the smallest observations have a median house value that is below the uh $119,500 and the remaining 75 uh% of our observations have a meeting house value that is above the $190,500 and then the uh Q3 which is the third quantile or the 75th percentile it describes this threshold the volume where we make a distinction between the um uh lowest median house values the first 75th uh% of the lowest uh median house values versus the uh most expensive so the highest median house values so what is this upper uh 25% uh when it comes to the median house value so we see that that distinction is 264,000 save $700 so it is somewhere in here which basically means that when it comes to this uh to this blocks of uh houses the most expensive ones with the highest valuation so the 25% top rated median house values they are above 264,000 that's something that we want to remove so we want to remove the observations that have a smallest median house value and the largest median house values and and usually it's a common practice when it comes to the inter quantile uh range approach to multiply the inter quantile range by 1.5 in order to um obtain the lower bound and the upper bound so to understand what are the um thresholds that we need to use in order to remove the uh blocks uh so observation from our data where the med house value is very small or very large so for that we will be multiply the IQR so inter quanti range by 1.5 and when we uh subtract this value from q1 then we will be getting our lower bound when uh we will be adding this value to Q3 then we will be using and getting this threshold when it comes to the uh upper bound and we will be seeing that um after we uh clean this uh outliers from our data we end up uh getting um smaller data so this means that uh previously we had uh 20K so 20,43 3 observations and now we have 9,369 observations so we have roughly removed um like about 1,000 or bit over 1,000 observations from our data so uh next let's look into some other variables for instance the median uh income and um one other technique that we can use in order to identify outliers in the data is by using the box plots so I wanted to showcase the different approaches that we can use in order to visualize the data and to identify outliers such that you will be familiar with uh different techniques so let's go ahead and plot the uh box plot and box plot is a statistical um way to represent your data uh the central boook uh represents the inter Quant range so um that is is the IQR uh and with the uh with the bottom and the top edges they indicate the 25th percentile so the first quantile and the 75% H so the third quantile respectively the length of this box that you see here uh this dark part is basically the 50% of your data for the median income and uh this uh median uh line inside this box um this is the uh the one with uh contrast in color that represents the median of the data set so the median is the middle value when data is sorted in an ascending order then we have this whiskers in our box Flo and this line of whiskers extends from the top and the bottom of the box and indicate this range for the rest of the data set excluding the outliers they are typically this 1.5 IQR above and 1.5 times um IQR uh below the q1 something that we also saw uh just previously when we were removing the outliers from the median house volum so in order to um identify the outliers you can quickly see that we have all these points that um lie above the 1.5 time IQR above the um third quantile so the 75% H and um that's something that you can also see here and this means that those are uh blocks of houses that have unusually high median income that's something that we want to remove from our data and therefore we can use the uh exactly the same approach that we used previously for the median house value so we will then identify the uh 25th percentile or the first quantile so q1 and then Q3 so the third quantile or the 75th percentile then we will compute the IQR um and then we will be obtaining the lower bound and the upper upper bound using this 1.5 um as a scale and then we will be using that this lower bound and upper bound to then um use this filters in order to remove from the data all the observations where the medium income is above the lower bound and all the observations that have a median income below the upper bound so we are using lower bound and upper bound to perform double filtering we are using two filters in the same row as you can see and we are using this parenthesis and this end functionality to tell to python well first look that this condition is satisfied so the observations have a median income that is above this lower bound and at the same time it should hold that the observation so the block should have a median income that is below the upper bound and if this uh block this observation in the data satisfies to two of this criteria then we are dealing with a good point a normal point and we can keep this and we are saying that this is our new data so let's actually go ahead and execute this code in this case we can see too high as all our out layers lie in this part of the box putot and then we will end up with the clean data I'm taking this clean data and then I'm putting it under data just for Simplicity and uh this data now uh is much more clean and uh it's better representation of the population something that ideally we want because we want to find out what are the features that uh describe and Define the house value not based on this unique and rare houses which are too expensive or which are in the blogs that have uh very high income uh people but rather we want to see the uh the uh true representation so the most frequently appearing data what are the features that Define the house value of the prices uh for common uh houses and for common areas for people with average or with normal income that's what we want to uh find so uh the next thing that I tend to do uh when it comes to especially regression nases and caal nases is to plot the correlation heat map so this means that uh we are getting the um uh correlation Matrix pairwise correlation score uh for each of this pair of variables in our data when it comes to the linear regression one of the uh assumptions of the linear regression that we learned during the theory part is that we should not have a perfect multicolinearity what this means is that there should not be a high correlation between pair of independent variables so knowing one should not help us to automatically Define the value of the other independent variable and if the correlation between the two independent variables is very high it means that we might potentially be dealing with multicolinearity that's something that we do want to avoid so hit map is a great way to identify whether we have this type of problematic independent variables and whether we need to drop any of them or maybe multiple of them to ensure that we are dealing with proper linear regression model and the assumptions lession model is satisfied now when we look at this correlation heat map um and uh here we use the curn in order to plot this as you can see here the colors can be from very light so white from till very dark green where uh the light means um there is a negative strong negative correlation and very dark uh green means that there is a very strong positive correlation so uh we know that correlation a value Pearson correlation can take values between minus one and 1 minus one means uh very strong negative correlation one means very strong positive correlation and um usually when uh we are dealing with correlation of the variable with itself so a correlation between longitude and longitude then uh this correlation is equal to one so as you can see on the diagonal we have there for all the ones because those are the pairwise correlation of the variables with themselves and then um in here uh all the values under the diagonal are actually equal to the uh mirror of them in the upper diagonal because the variable between so the correlation between uh the same two variables independent of how we put it so which one we put first and which one the second is going to be the same so basically correlation between longitude and ltitude and correlation latitude and longitude is the same so um now we have refreshed our memory on this let's now look into the actual number and this heat map so as we can see here we have this section where we um have uh variables independent variables um that have a low uh positive correlation with the uh remaining independent variables so you can see here that we have this light green uh values which indicate a low positive relationship between pair of variables one thing that is very interesting here is the middle part of this heat map where we have this dark numbers so the numbers uh below the diagonals are something we can interpret and remember that below diagonal and above diagonal is basically the mirror we here already see a problem because we are dealing with variables which are going to be independent variables in our model that have a high correlation now why is this a problem because one of the assumptions of linear regression like we saw during the theory section is that we should not have a multiple uh colinearity so multicolinearity problem when we have perfect multicolinearity it means that we are dealing with independent variables that have a high correlation knowing a value one variable will help us to know automatically what is the value of the other one and when we have a correlation of 0.93 which is very high or 0.98 this means that those two variables those two independent variables they have a super high positive relationship this is a problem because this might cause our model to result in uh very large standard errors and also not accurate and not generalizable model that's something we want to avoid and and uh we want to ensure that the assumptions of our model are satisfied now um we are dealing with independent variable which is total underscore bedrooms and households which means that number of total bedrooms uh pair block and the uh households is highly correlated positively correlated and this a problem so ideally what we want to do is to drop one of those two independent variables and and uh the reason why we can't do that is because uh those two variables given that they are highly correlated they already uh explain similar type of information so they contain similar type of variation which means that including the two just it doesn't make sense on one hand it's uh violating the moral assumptions potentially and on the other hand it's not even adding too much volum because the other one already shows similar variation so um the total underscore bedrooms basically contains similar type of information as the households so we can as well um so we can better just drop one of those uh two independent variables now uh the question is which one and that's something that we can uh Define by also looking at other correlations in here because we uh have a total bedrooms uh having a high correlation with households but we can also see that the total underscore rooms has a very high correlation with our households so this means that there is yet another independent variable that has a high correlation with our households variable and then this total underscore rooms has also High uh correlation with the total underscore bedroom so this means that um we can decide which one is has um more frequently uh High correlation with the rest of independent variables and in this case it seems like that the largest two numbers in here are the um this one and this one so we see that the total bedroom has a 0.93 as correlation with the total underscore rooms and uh at the same time we also see that hotel bedrooms has also um very high correlation with the household so 0.98 which means that total underscore bedrooms has the highest correlation with the remaining independent variables so we might as well drop this independent variable but before you do that I would suggest to do one more quick visual check and it is to look into the total uncore bedroom correlation with the dependent variable to understand how strong of a relationship does this have on the response variable that we are looking into so we see that the uh total underscore bedroom uh has this one 0.05 correlation with the response variable so the median house value when it comes to the total rooms that one has much higher so I'm already seeing from here that uh we can feel comfortable uh excluding and dropping the total underscore bedroom from our data in order to ensure that we are not dealing with perfect multicolinearity so this exactly what I'm doing here so I'm dropping the um total bedrooms so after doing that we no longer have this uh total bedrooms as the column so before moving on to the actual CA analysis there is one more step that I wanted to uh show you uh which is super important when it comes to the POS analysis and some uh introductory econometrical stuff so uh when you have a string categorical variable there are a few ways that you can deal with them one easy way that you will see um on the web is to perform one H encoding which basically means transforming all this uh string values so um we have a near Bay less than 1 hour ocean uh Inland near Ocean Iceland to transform all these values to some numbers such that we we have for the ocean proximity variable values such as 1 2 3 4 5 one way of doing that can be uh something like this but better way when it comes to using this type of variables in linear regression is to transform this a string uh category type of variable to what we're calling dami variables so dami variable means that this variable takes two possible values and usually uh it is a binary Boolean variable which means that it can take two possible values zero and one where one means that the condition is satisfied and zero means condition is not satisfied so let me give you an example in this specific case we have that the ocean proximity has five different values and ocean proximity is just a single variable then uh what we will do is we will use the uh get underscore D function in Python from pandas in order to uh go from this one variable to a five different variable per each of this category which means that now we will have new variables that uh will uh basically be uh whether uh it is uh nearby or not whether it's less than 1 hour uh uh from the ocean uh variable whether it's Inland whether it's near Ocean or whether is an island this will be a separate binary variable a dummy variable that will take value 0 and one which means that we are going from one string categorical variable to five different dami variables and in this case um each of those dami variables that you can see here we are creating five dami variables each of each for uh each of those five categories and then uh we are combining them and uh from the original data we will then be dropping the ocean prox IM data so on one hand we are getting rid of this string variable which is a problematic variable for linear regression when combined with the pyler library because cyler cannot handle this type of um data when it comes to linear regression and B we are making our job easier when it comes to interpreting the results so uh interpreting linear regression for CER nazes uh is much more easy when we have dami variables then when we have a one string categorical variable so just to give you an example if we are creating from this string variable uh five different dami variables and those are those five different dami variables that you can see in here so this means that if we are looking at this one category so let's say uh ocean _ proximity under Inland it means that for all the rows where we have the value equal to zero it means this criteria is not satisfied which means that uh ocean proximity uh underscore Inland is equal to zero which means that the house blob we are dealing with is not from Inland so that criteria is not satisfied and otherwise if this value is equal to one so for all these rows when the ocean proximity Inland is equal to one It means that the criteria is satisfied and we are dealing with house blocks that are indeed in the Inland one thing thing to keep in mind uh when it comes to uh transforming a string categorical variable to um set of DS is that you always need to drop at least one of the categories and the reason for this is because we learned during the theory that uh we should have no perfect multicolinearity this means that um we cannot have five different variables that are perfectly correlated and if we include all these values and this variables it means that um when uh we know that the uh uh block of houses is not near the bay is not less than 1 hour ocean is not Inland is not near the ocean automatically we know that it should be the remaining category which is Inland so we know that for all those blocks the um uh ocean proximity underscore uh uh irand uh Iceland will be equal to one and that's something that we want to avoid because because that is the definition of perfect multicolinearity So to avoid one of the oils assumptions to be violated we need to drop one of those categories so uh we can see in here uh that's exactly uh what I'm doing I'm saying so let's go ahead and actually drop one of those variables so let's see first what is the set of all variables we got so we got less than one hour uh ocean Inland Iceland new bay and then uh new ocean let's actually drop one of them so let's drop the Iceland and uh that we can do very simply by let me see I is not allowing me to add a code in here so we are doing data is equal to uh and then data do drop and then the name of the variable we within the uh quotation marks and then uh X is = to 1 so in this way I'm basically dropping one of the uh daming variables that uh I created in order to avoid the perfect multicolinearity assumption to be violated and once I go ahead and print the columns now we should see uh this uh column uh disappearing here we go so we successfully deleted that variable let's go ahead and actually get the head so now you can see that we no longer have a string in our data but instead we got four additional binary variable out of a string categorical variable with five categories all right now we are ready to do the actual work uh when it comes to the training a machine learning model uh or statistical model we learn during the uh theory that we always need to split that data into train uh and test set that is the minimum in some cases we also need to do train validation and test such that we can train the model on the training data and then optimize the model on validation data and find out what is the optimal set of hyperparameters and then uh use this information to uh apply this fitted and optimized model on an unseen test data we are going to skip the validation set for Simplicity especially given that we are dealing with a very simple machine learning model as linear regression and we're going to split our data into train and test and here uh what I'm going to do is first I'm creating this list of the name or variables that we are going to use in order to um train our machine learning bottle so uh we have a set of independent variables and a set of dependent variable so in our multiple linear regression here is the set of uh independent variables that we will have so we have long itude latitude housing median Edge total rooms population households median income median house value and the four different categorical dami uh four different uh dami variables that we built from the categorical variable then um I am specifying that the uh Target variable is so the target so the response variable or the dependent variable is the um median house value this is the value that we want to uh uh Target because we want to see what are the features and what are the independent variables out of the set of all features that have a statistically significant impact on the uh dependent variable which is the median house value because we want to find out what are these features um describing the houses in the block that cause a change cause a variation in the um t Target variable such as the Medan house value so here we have X is equal to and then uh from the data we are taking all the features that have the following names and then we have the uh Target which is a midin house uh house value and that's uh the column that we are going to subtract and select from the data so we are doing data filtering so here we are then selecting and what I'm using here is the train test complete function from the psych learn so you might recall that in the beginning we spoke and imported this uh model selection um library and from the cyler model selection we imported the train _ testore Spate function now this is a function that you are going to need quite a lot in machine learning because this a very easy way to uh split your data so um in here uh the arguments of the this function is first the uh Matrix or the data frame that contains the independent variables in our case X so here you fill in X and then the second uh argument is the dependent variable so uh the Y and then we have test size which means um what is the uh proportion of um observations that you want to put in the test and what is the proportion of observation that you um don't want to put basically in the training if you are putting 0.2 it means that you want your test size to be uh 20% of your entire 100% of data and the remaining 80% will be your training data so if you provide your point two to this argument then the function automatically understands that you want this 80 20 division so 80% training and then 20% test size and then finally you can also uh add the random State because the split is going to be random so the data is going to be randomly selected from the entire data and to ensure that your results are reproducible and uh the next time you are running this um notebook you will get the same results and also to ensure that me and you get the same results we will be using a random State and a random state of 111 is just um random number there I liked and decided to use here so uh when we go in um use this and run this command you can see that we have a training set size 15K and then test size uh 38k so when you look at these numbers you will then get a verification that you are dealing with 20% versus 80% thresholds so then we go and we do the training one thing to keep in mind is that here we are using the SM Library uh NSM function that we imported from the uh stats model. API so this is one one uh function that we can use in order to conduct our uh Cal analysis and to train Le regression model so uh for that what we need to do so uh when we are using this Library uh this Library doesn't automatically add the uh first uh column of ones uh in your uh set of independent variables which means that it only goes and looks at what are the features that you have provided and those are all the independent variables but we learned from the theory that uh when it comes to linear regression we always are adding this intercept so the beta0 if you go back to the theory lectures you can see this beta0 to be added to both to the simple linear regression and to the multipar regression this ensures that we look at this intercept and we see what is this average uh in this case median house value if all the other features are um equal to zero so um therefore given that the this specific stats models. API is not adding this uh constant um column to the beginning for intercept it means that we need to add this manually therefore we are saying sm. addore constant to the exrain which means that U now our uh x uh table or X data frame uh add a column of ones uh to the features so let me actually show you uh before doing the uh training because I think this also something that you should be aware of so if we do here a pause so I'm going to do xcore train underscore uh constant and then I'm also going to print um the same um feature data frame before adding this constant such that you see what I mean so as you can see here this is just the same set of all columns that form the independent variables the features so then when we add the constant now after doing that you can see that now we have this initial column of ones this is th such that we can have uh uh beta Z at the end which is the intercept and we can then perform a valid multiple linear regression otherwise you don't have an intercept and this is just not what you're looking for now the psychic learn Library does this automatically therefore when you are using uh this tou models. API you should add this constant and then I use the pyit learn without adding the constant and if you're wondering why to use this specific model as uh we already discussed about this just to refresh your memory we are using the T models. API because this one has this nice property of visualizing the summary of your result results so your P values your test your standard errors something that you definitely are looking for when you are performing a proper causal analysis and you want to identify the features that have a statistically significant impact on your dependent variable if you are using a machine learning model including linear regression only for Predictive Analytics so in that case you can use the psychic learn without worrying about using STS models. API so this is about adding constant uh now we are ready to actually uh fit our model or train our model therefore what we need to do is to use sm. OLS so OS is the ordinar squares estimation technique that we also discussed as part of the theory and we need to provide first the dependent variable so Yore train and then the um feature set which is xcore train uncore constant so then what we need to do is to do that feed par paresis which means that take the OS model and use the Yore train as my dependent variable and xcore Trainor constant as my independent variable set and then fit the OLS algorithm and linear regression on this specific data if you're wondering why y train or X train and what is the differ between train and test and sure to go and revisit the training um Theory lectures because there I go in detail into this concept of training and testing and how we can divide the data into train and test and uh this Y and X as we have already discussed during this tutorial is simply this distinction between independent variables defined by X and the dependent variable defined by y so y train y test is the dependent variable data for the training data and test data and then EXT train ex uh test is simply the training data features so ex train and then test data features X test we need to use x train and Y train to fit our data to learn from the data and then once it comes down to evaluating the model we need to uh use the fitted model from which we have learned using both the dependent variable and the independent variable set so y train X train and then uh once we have this model uh that is fitted we can apply this to unseen data exore test we have can obtain the predictions and we can compare this to the true y so Yore test and to see how different the Y uh underscore test is from the Y predictions for this unseen data and to evaluate how moral uh is performing this prediction so how moral is uh managing to identify the median uh house values and predict median house uh values based on the uh um fitted model and on an unseen data so exore test so this is just a background info and some refreshment and now um in this case we are just uh fitting the data on the training uh dependent variable and then training uh independent variable edit a constant and then we are ready to print the summary now let's now interpret those results first thing that we can see is that uh all the coefficients and all the independent variables are statistically significant and how can I say this well um if we look in here we can see the column of P values this is the first thing that you need to look at when you are getting this results of a caal analysis in linear oppression so here we are seeing that the P value is very small and just to refresh our memory P value says what is this probability that you have obtained too high of a test statistics uh given that this is just by a random chance so you are seeing statistically significant results which is just by random chance and not because your uh n hypothesis is false and you need to reject it so that's one thing in here you can see you can see that we are getting much more so first thing that you can do is to verify that you have used the correct dependent variable so you can see here that the dependent variable is a median house value the model that is used to estimate those coefficients in your model is the OS the method is the Le squares so Le squares is simply uh the uh technique that is the underlying approach of minimizing the sum of uh uh squared residuals so the least squares the date that we are running this analysis is the 26th of January of 2024 uh so we have the number of observations which is the number of training observations so the 80% of our original data we have R squ which is the um Matrix that showcases what is the um goodness of fat of your model so r s is a matrix that is commonly used in linear regression specifically to identify how good your model is able to fit your data with this linear regression line and the r squ uh the maximum of R squ is one and the minimum is zero 0.58 uh in this case approximately 59 it means that uh all your data that you got and all your independent variables so those are all the independent variables that you have included they are able to explain 59% so 0.59 out of the entire set of variation so 59% of variation in your response variable which is the median house value you are able to explain with a set of independent variables that you have provided to the model now what does this mean on one hand it means that you have a reasonable enough information so anything above 0.5 is quite good which means that more than half of the uh entire variation in your median house value you are able to explain but on the other hand it means also that there is approximately 40% of variation so information about your house values that you don't have in your data this means that you might consider going and looking for extra additional information so additional independent variables to add on the top of the existing independent variables in order to increase this amount and to increase the amount of information and variation that you are able to explain with your model so the r squ this is like the best way to uh explain what is the quality of your regression model another thing that we have is the adjusted R squ adjusted R squ and R squ in this specific case as you can see they are the same so 0 um 59 this usually means that uh you're fine when it comes amount of features that you are using once you overwhelm your model with too many features you will notice that the adjusted R squ will be different than your R squ so adjusted R squ helps you to understand whether your Motel is performing well only because you are adding so many of you of those variables or because really they contain some useful information CU sometimes the r squ it will automatically increase just because you are adding too many independent variables but in some cases those independ variables they are not useful so they are just adding to the complexity of the model and possibly overfitting your model but not providing any edit information then we have the F statistics here which corresponds to the F test and uh F test um it comes from statistics uh you don't need to know it but I would say uh check out the fundamentals to statistics course if you do want to know it because it means that uh you are testing whether all these independent variables Al together whether they are helping to explain your uh dependent variable so the median house value and uh if the F statistics is very large or the P value of your F statistics is very small so 0.0 it means that all your independent variables jointly are statistically significant which means that all of them together helped you explain your uh uh median house value and have a statistically significant impact or your median house value which means that you have a good set of independent variables so then we have the log likelihood not super relevant in this case you have the AIC Bic which stand for AAS information criteria and bation information criteria those are also not necessary to know for now but once you advance in your career in machine learning it might be useful to know at higher level for now think of it like um value that helps to understand this uh information that you gain when you are adding this set of independent variables to your model but this is just optional ignore it if you don't know it for now okay let's now go into the fun part so in this Mata uh part of the summary uh table we got first the set of uh independent variables so we have our constant which is The Intercept we have the longitude latitude housing median age total roles population households median income and the four dami variables that we have created then we have the coefficients corresponding to those independent variables those are basically the beta0 beta 1 head beta 2 head Etc which are the um parameters of the linear regression model that our oils method has estimated based on the data that we have provided now before interpreting this independent variables the first thing you need to do as I mentioned in the beginning is to look at this P value column this showcases the set of all independent variables that are statistically significant and usually this table that you will get from a Sato API is at 5% significance level so the alpha the threshold of statistical significance is equal to 5% and any P value that is smaller than 0.05 it means you are dealing with a statistically significant independent variable now the next thing that you can see here in the left is the T statistics this P value is based on a t test so this T Test is simply stating as we have learned during the theory and you can also check the fundamental to statistics course from lunar tech for more detailed understanding of this test but for now this T Test um States a hypothesis whether um each of these independent variables individually has a statistically significant impact on the dependent variable and whenever this uh T Test has a p value that is smaller than the 0.05 it means you are dealing with statistically significant uh independent variable in this case we are super lucky all our independent variables are statistically significant then the question is whether we have a positive statistical significant or negative that's something that you can see by the signs of these numbers so you can see that longitude has a negative coefficient latitude negative coefficient housing median age positive coefficient Etc negative coefficient means that this independent variable causes a negative change in the dependent variable so more specifically when we look for instance the um let's say which one should we look uh let's say the uh total uh underscore rooms when we look at the total underscore rooms and it's minus 2.67 it means that when we look at this total number of rooms and we increase the number of rooms uh by uh one additional unit so one more room added to the total underscore rooms then the uh house value uh decreases by minus 2.67 now you might be wondering but how is this possible well first of all the value the coefficient is quite small so in one hand it's it's not super relevant as we can see the uh relationship between them is not super strong because the U margin of this um coefficient is quite small but on the other hand you can explain that at some point when you are adding more rooms it just doesn't add any value and in fact in some cases just decreases the value of the house this might be the case at least this is the case based on this data we can see that if there is a negative coefficient then one unit increase in that specific independent variables all else constant will result in um uh in this case for instance in case of the total rooms uh 2.67 decrease in the median house value everything else constant we are also referring to this ass set that is parus in econometric which means that everything else constant so one more time let's refresh our memory on this so ensure that we are clear on this if we add one more room to the total number of rooms then the median house value will decrease by $267 and this when the longitude latitude house median age population households median income and all the other criterias are the same so if we have uh for instance this negative value this means that we are getting a decrease in the median house value if we have an increase by one unit in our uh total number of roles now let's look at the op opposite uh case when the coefficient is actually positive and large which is the hous in median age this means is if we have two houses they have uh exactly the same characteristics so they have the same longitude latitude they have the same total number of rooms population housing households median income they are uh the same in terms of the distance from the ocean then um if one of these houses has one more additional year added on the uh median age so housing median age so it's one year older then the house value of this specific house is higher by $846 so this house which has one more additional median age has $ 846 higher median house value compared to the one that has all these characteris ICS except it has just the um uh house median age that uh is one year less so one more additional uh year in the median age will result in 846 uh increase in the mediate house value everything else constant so this is regarding this idea of negative and imp positive and then the margin of coefficient now let's look at one dami variable and um explain the idea behind it and how we can interpret it and uh it's it's a good way to understand how the dond variables can be interpreted in the context of linear regression so one of the independent variables is the ocean proximity Inland and the coefficient is equal to- 2108 e plus 0.5 this simply means - 210 K uh approximately and um what this means is that if we have two houses they have exactly the same characteristics so their longitude latitude is the same house median age is the same they have the same total number of rooms population households median income all these characteristics for this two blocks of houses is the same with a single difference that one block is located in the um Inland when it comes to Ocean proximity and the other block of houses is not located in the Inland so in this case the reference so the um category that we have removed from here was the Iceland you might recall uh so if the block of houses is in the Inland that their value is on average uh smaller and less by 210k when it comes to the median house value compared to the block of houses that has exactly the same characteristics but it's not in the Inland so for instance is in the uh Iceland so uh when it comes to this dumi variables where there is also an underlying reference variable which you have deleted as part of your string categorical variable then you need to reference your dami variable to that specific category this might sound complex it is actually not I would say uh it's just a matter of practicing and trying to understand what is this approach of D variable it means that you either have that criteria or not in this specific case it means that if you have two blocks of houses with exactly the same characteristics and one block of houses is in the Inland and the other one is not in the Inland for instance is in the Iceland then the block of houses in the Inland will have on average 210,000 less uh median house value compared to the block of houses that is the IND for instance in the Iceland uh when it comes to the ocean proximity which kind of uh makes sense because in California people might prefer living uh in the isoland location in the houses might have more demand when it comes to the Iceland location compared to the um Inland locations so the longitude uh has a statistically significant impact on the uh median house value latitude house median age has an impact and causes a a statistically significant difference in the Medan house value if there is a change in median age the total number of rooms have an impact on the median house volume and the population has an impact households median income as well as the uh proximity from the ocean and this is because all their P values is uh zero which means that they are smaller than 0.05 and this means that they all have a statistically significant impact on the median house value in the Californian house in market now when it comes to the uh interpretation of all of them uh we have interpreted just few uh for the sake of Simplicity and ensuring that this uh this entire case study doesn't take too long but what I would suggest you to do is to uh interpret all of the uh coefficients here because we have interpreted just the housing median age and the um the total number of rooms but you can also interpret the population uh as well as the median income and uh we have also interpreted one of those Dy variables but feel free also to interpret all the other ones so by doing this you can also uh Even build an entire case study paper in which you can explain in one or two pages the results that you have obtained and this will showcase that you have an understanding of how you can interpret the linear gressional results another thing that I would suggest you to do is to uh add a comment on the standard error so let's now look into the standard errors we can see a huge standard error that we are um making and this is the direct result of the fourth assumption that was violated now this case study is super important and useful in a way that it showcases what happens if some of your um assumptions are satisfied and if some of those assumptions are violated so in this specific specific case the Assumption related to the uh uh the errors having a constant variance is violated so we have a heos SK assist the issue and that's something that we are seeing back in our results and this is a very good example of the case that even without checking the assumptions you can already see that the standard error is very large and uh you can see here that given that the standard ER is large this already gives a hint that most most likely our heteroscedasticity uh is present and our homoscedasticity assumption is violated you keep in mind this um idea of um large standard errors that we just saw because we are going to see that this becomes a problem also for the um performance of the model and we will see that we are obtaining a large error due to this and uh one more comment when it comes to the total rooms and the housing median age in some cases the linear regression results might not seem logical but sometimes they actually is an underlying explanation that can be provided or maybe your model is just overfitting or biased that's also possible and uh that's something that uh you can do by checking your ois assumptions and uh before uh going to that stage I wanted to briefly showcase to you this um idea of predictions so we have now fitted our model on the uh uh training data and we are ready to perform the predictions so we can then use our fitted model and we can then uh use the test data so ex test in order to perform the predictions so to uh use a data to get new house mediate house values for the um blocks of houses for which we are not providing the uh corresponding Medan house price so on aning data we are uh re um applying our model that we have already fitted and we want to see what are these predicted median house values and then we can compare these predictions to the true median house values that we have but we are not yet exposing them and we want to see how good our model is doing a job of estimating and finding these unknown median house values for the test data so for all the blocks of houses for which we provided the characteristics in the X test but we are not providing the Y test so uh as usual like in case of training we are adding a constant with this library and then we are saying model. fitted model uncore fitted so the fitted model and then that predict and providing the test data and those are the test predictions now uh once we do this we can then get the test predictions and uh if we print those you can see that we are getting a least of house values those are the house values for the um um blocks of houses which were included as part of the testing data so the 20% of our entire data set uh like I mentioned just before in order to ensure that your model is performing well you need to check the OS assumptions so uh during the um Theory section we learned that there are a couple of assumptions that your model should satisfy and your data should satisfy for OLS to provide uh B unbiased and um efficient uh estimates which means that they are accurate their standard error is low something that um we are also seeing as part of the summary results and uh your estimates are accurate so the standard error is a measure that showcases how efficient your estimat are which means um do you have a high variation uh can the coefficients that you are showing in this table very a lot which means that you don't have accurate um coefficient and your coefficient can be all the way from one place to the other so the range is very L large which means that your standard error will be very large and this is a bad sign or you are dealing with an accurate estimation and uh it's more precise estimation and in that case the standard there will be low uh and unbias estimate means that your estimates are are a true representation of the pattern between each pair of independent variable and the response variable if you want to learn more about this IDE of bias unbias and then efficiency and sure to check the U fundamental statistics course at lunar Tech because it explains very clearly this Concepts in detail so here I'm assuming that you know or maybe you don't even need it but I would suggest you to know at higher level at least then uh let's quickly do the checking of oiless assumption so the first assumption is the linearity Assumption which means that your model is linear in parameters one way of checking that is by using your already fitted model and your uh predicted model so the Y uh uh test which are your true house median house values for your test data and then test predictions which are your uh predicted median house values for nonen data so you are using the uh True Values and the predicted values in order to um plot them and then to also plot the best fitted line in an ideal situation when you would make no error and your model would give you the exact True Values um and then see how well your um uh how linear is this relationship do we actually have a linear relationship now if the observed versus predicted values where the observed means the uh real uh test test wise and the predicted means the test predictions if this pattern is kind of linear and matching this perfect linear line then you have um assumption one that is satisfied your linearity assumption is satisfied and you can say that your uh data uh and your model is indeed linear in parameters then uh we have the second assumption which states that your uh sample should be random and this basically translates that the uh expectation of your error terms should be equal to zero and uh one way of checking this is by simply taking the residuales from your fitted model so model on score fitted and then that's residual so you take the residuales you obtain the average which is a good estimate of your expectation of errors and then this is the mean of residuales so the average uh residuales where the residual is the estimate of your true error terms and then uh here what I do is just I just round up uh to the two decimals behind uh the uh the point this means that uh we are getting uh this average amount of uh errors or the estimate of the errors which we are referring as residuales and if this number is equal to zero which is the case so the mean of the residuales in our model is zero it means that indeed the um uh expectation of the uh error terms at least the estimate of it expectation of the residuales is inde equal to zero another way of checking the um uh second assumption which is that the um moral uh has a is based on the random sample and the sample we are using is random which means that the expectation of the error terms is equal to zero is by plotting the residuales versus fitted values so uh we are taking the resid from the fitted model and we are comparing to the fitted values that comes from the model uh and we are looking at this um graph this scatter plot which you can see in here and we're looking where this um pattern is uh symmetric uh around the uh threshold of zero so you can see this line kind of comes right in the middle of this pattern which means that on average we have residuales that are across zero so the mean of the residuales is equal to zero and that's exactly what we were calculating also here therefore we can say that we are indeed dealing with a random sample this FL is also super useful when it comes to the fourth assumption that we will come a bit later so for now let's check the third assumption which is the Assumption of exogeneity so exogeneity means that uh each of our independent variables should be uncorrelated from the error terms so there is no omitted variable bias there is no um reverse causality which means that the uh independent variable has an impact on the dependent variable but not the other way around so dependent variable should not have an impact and should not cause the independent variable so for that there are few ways that we can deal with uh with this uh one way is just straightforward to compute the uh correlation coefficient between between each of these independent variables and the residuales that you have obtained from your fitted model the just simple uh technique that you can use in a very uh quick way to understand what is this uh correlation between each pair of independent variable and the residuals which are the best estimates of your error terms and in this way you can understand that there is a correlation between your independent variables and your error terms another way you can do that and this is more advanced and bit more um towards the econometrical side is by using this test which is called the Durban uh view housan test so this uh Durban view housan test is um a more professional more advanced way of uh using an econometrical test to find out whether you have um exogene so exogeneity sup is satisfied or you have endogenity which means that one or multiple of your your independent variables is potentially correlated with your error terms uh I won't go into detail of this test uh I'll put some explanation here and also feel free to uh check any uh introductory to econometrics course to understand more on this Duran Vu housan test for exogeneity assumption the fourth assumption that we will talk about is the homos skasis homosa assumption states that the error terms should have a variance that is constant which means that when we are looking at this variation that uh the model is making uh across uh different observations that uh when we look at them the variation is kind of constant so uh we have all these uh cases when the uh in observations for which the residuals are bit small in some cases bit large we have this miror when it comes to this figure with what we are calling heteros skos which means means that homos assumption is violated our error terms do not have a variation that is constant across all the observations and we have a high variation and different variations for different observations so we have the heteros issue we should consider a bit more um flexible approaches like uh GLS fgs GMM all bit more advanced econometrical algorithms so uh the final part of this case study will be to show you how you can do uh this all but for machine learning traditional machine learning site by using the psychic learn so uh in here um I'm using the um standard scaler function in order to uh scale my data because we saw uh in the summary of the table um that we got from the stats uh mos. API that our data is at a very high scale because the uh median house values are those large numbers the uh age uh the median age of the house is in this very large numbers that's something that you want to avoid when you are using the linear regression as a Predictive Analytics model when you are using it for interpreting purposes then you should keep the skilles because it's easier to interpret those values and to understand uh what is the difference in the median price uh of the house when you compare different characteristics of the box of houses but when it comes to using it for Predictive Analytics purposes which means that you really care about the accuracy of your predictions then you need to uh scale your data and ensure that your data is standardized one way of doing that is by using the standard scaler function uh in the pyit learn. preprocessing uh and uh the way I do it is that I initialize the scaler by using the standard scaler and then parenthesis which are just import from this psychic learn library and then uh I am uh taking this scaler I'm doing that fitore transform exrain which basically means take the independent variables and ensure that we scale and standardize the data and standardization simply means that uh we are standardizing the data that we have to ensure that um some large values do not wrongly influence the predictive power of the model so the the model is not confused by the large numbers and finds a wrong variation but instead it focuses on the a true variation in the data based on how much the change in one independent variable causes a change in the dependent variable here given that we are dealing with the supervised learning algorithm uh the exrain uh scaled will be then containing our standardized uh features so independent variables and then each test SC will contain our standardized test features so the Unseen data that the model will not see during the training but only during prediction and then what we will be doing is that we will also use the um y train and Y train uh is the dependent variable in now supervised model and why train corresponds to the training data so we will then first initialize the linear regression here so linear regression model from pyit learn and then uh we will initialize the model this is just the empty linear regression model and then we will take this initialized uh model and then we will fit them on the uh training data so exore trained uncore scale so this is the trained features and then the um uh dependent variable from training data so why train uh do you knowe that I'm not scaling the dependent variable this is a common practice cuz you don't want to uh standardize your dependent variable rather than you want to ensure that your features are standardized because what you care is about the variation in your features and to ensure that the model doesn't mess up when it's learning from those features less when it comes to looking into the impact of those features on your dependent variable so then uh I am fitting the uh model on this training data so uh features and independent variable and then I'm using this fitted uh model the LR which already has learned from this features and dependent variable during supervised training and then I'm using the X test scale so the test standardized uh data in order to uh perform the prediction so to predict the immediate house values for the test data unseen data and you can notice that here in no places I'm using white test white test I'm keeping to myself which is the dependent variable True Values such that I can then compare to this predicted values and see how well my motor was able to actually get the predictions now uh let's actually also do one more step I'm importing from the psyit learn the Matrix such as mean squared error uh and I'm using the mean squared error to find out how well my motel was able to predict those house prices so this means that uh we have on average we are making an error of 59,000 of dollars when it comes to the median house prices which uh dependent on what we consider as large or small this is something that we can look into so um like I mentioned in the beginning the uh idea behind linear regression using IND specific uh course is not to uh use it in terms of pure traditional machine learning but rather than to perform um causal analysis and to see how we can interpret it when it comes to the quality of the predictive power of the model then uh if you want to improve this model this can be considered as the next step you can understand whether your model is overfitting and then the next step could be to apply for instance the um lasso regularization so lasso regression which addresses the overfitting you can also consider going back and removing more outliers from the data Maybe the outliers that we have removed was not enough so you can also apply that factor then another thing that you can do is to consider bit more advanced machine learning algorithms because it can be that um although the um regression assumption is satisfied but still um using bit more flexible Motors like random Forest decision trees or boosting techniques will be bit more more appropriate and this will give you higher predictive power consider also uh uh working more with this uh scaled uh version or normalization of your data as the next step in your machine Learning Journey you can consider learning bit more advanced machine learning models so now when you know in detail what is linear regression and how you can use it how you can train and test a machine learning Model A simple one yet very popular one and you also know what is logistic progression and all these Basics you're ready to go on to the next step which is learning all the other popular traditional machine learning models think about learning decision trees for modeling nonlinear relationships think about learning bagging boosting random forest and different sours of optimization algorithms like gradi and descent HGD HGD with momentum Adam Adam V RMS prop and what is the difference between them and how you can Implement them and also consider a learning clustering approaches like K means uh DB skin hierarchial clust string doing this will help you uh to get more hands on and go to this next step when it comes to the machine learning once you have covered all these fundamentals you are ready to go one step further which is getting into deep Le thank you for watching this video If you like this content make sure to check all the other

      "[Document(page_content=\"in this course you'll dive into deploying expressjs and node.js applications on AWS Lambda using neon serverless postgress and the serverless framework by the end of this course you'll also learn how to adapt your deployment for versel alongside mastering database setup migrations GitHub actions and more Justin Mitchell developed this course Justin has created many excellent courses on his coding for entrepreneurs course platform and his YouTube channel neon provided Grant to make this course possible hello and welcome to the serverless nodejs API course in this one we are going to learn about expressjs to build what's called a rest API now we're really going to be building a JavaScript application that runs on the back end in a serverless environment which really means that we just focus on our code we don't have to focus on the servers at all now traditionally speaking when it comes to seress a big challenge that comes up is what database to use in and how do we actually connect to it now for that we're going to be using neon and servess postgres neon is actually Paving the way for so many applications to leverage serverless databases as well and of course they are a partner in this course but the idea here is we need an application that we can scale up or scale down as needed and we'll do that using AWS Lambda serverless functions but then we will also need our database to match that scaling up and scaling down and that's where neon comes in but it gets better better than that what we can do is we can also have multiple versions of our application deployed so we can do these iterations share them with other people and test out little pieces of it while also simultaneously having our database made and ready for that neon does this really cool thing to Branch data at any given time you can look at a point in time and Branch it so you can work on multiple versions of your application at once and allow people to use it without having major overhead to make all of this work it's fantastic it's a really straightforward way to do all of this now the idea here is really going back into focusing on the code and being able to iterate as much and as fast as we possibly can so sure we are going to be deploying an API service itself but that's really just for a foundational piece so we can actually focus on getting our code better and better and better over time so this is really about setting that foundation and serverless is the perfect way to do it so let's talk a little bit more about why serverless is important and why you should care about it let's talk about what servus means for your application and why you should consider using it first and foremost it's all about focusing just on the code and effectively running that code now the best analogy I have is lights like quite literally the lights in your room right so when you walk into your room you turn your lights on when you walk out you turn them off right but what if you forget to turn them off well they just keep running whether or not you're using those lights or not servus is just like that now a normal server application you turn the server on when you want it to run and you could leave it running forever that doesn't mean it's being used all the time but it does mean that it's running forever now of course there's a lot of cost Associated to that to have it run forever because computers just have a bunch of teeny little lights that really that's how it works right but the idea being that if you leave it on it's going to continue to run always but there's another part of this is like what if you have just a small little light turned on maybe it's just your desk light and that's the light that you have on and then when you leave that desk light is still on but then a 100 people walk into the room that desk light is not going to light up the room you'll need a lot more lights to do that and therefore you would have to scale your lights up now it's not any different in a server environment when you have one server yes you can have a tiny server that maybe costs a few bucks a month to actually run your application but as soon as you get thousands of people trying to access that server well you're going to need to scale up you're going to need to load balance across all of these different other servers which means that you'll have to actually understand the infrastructure behind it you'll have to learn how to scale those things up now don't get me wrong I find that stuff really fascinating it's something that I really like doing it's a fun orchestration but the thing is not everyone's ready for that or is interested in doing that especially with business critical applications maybe you don't want to manage those servers and so that's where these serverless Services come in servus is really just focusing on the code you deploy your code and then somebody else makes sure that all the systems scale up to meet the demand and all that scaling happens automatically but when you use something like AWS Lambda you just focus on making sure your code runs and then once it does run you can deploy it to Lambda Lambda will scale up and scale down to meet request demands now Lambda isn't the only servoless service that's out there there are other servess options but Lambda is a great one it's one that helped Pioneer so much of what we take for granted with serverless today so it's actually really great but actually deploying to Lambda presents a few problems for us number one deploying directly to Lambda with code is tricky there's a lot of different things that we need to consider with doing that and if you don't know AWS it becomes even more tricky because there's a lot to AWS and that's where we use something like the serverless framework we really just use the open source framework to help orchestrate the deployment to Lambda so that it's only a few commands instead of trying to figure out a bunch of commands in there now there are things that we will discuss in terms of I am or access policies and all that with servis and AWS um but you know it actually is fairly straightforward with servess I've I've seen a lot of different Services over the years that deploy to AWS Lambda I can honestly say that servess is one of the best if not the best way to do it specifically for Lambda and what we're trying to do with nodejs now the other part that comes as a challenge when it does deploy a serverless application the serverless application typically doesn't interact well with databases because databases themselves historically are always on that's because they pretty much always need to be available to grab that data so traditionally speaking that's what they do and the reason we're using neon and well neon is pioneering this serverless for databases and specifically for SQL databases and postgres postgres is probably the most used database in the world and so a serverless postes really just unlocks this for your database as well so in addition to your code application your database is going to do that as well now there's a huge advantag as to having serverless databases as well is this point in time branching so what's going to happen is whenever you need a copy of your database with neon you can just Branch it just like you would with your code and it will actually make a point in time copy of that data so then you can actually stage your application many many different times so if you're working on version 10 or version one and all of the versions in between between you can actually create different branches of that in your database do the migrations make the changes that you need for your database all right there and all of this is possible because of how they approach serverless and how easy they make it for your applications to run and consume all of this stuff so that's really what we're going to be doing is orchestrating all these things together now I realize it might sound complicated but it's actually fairly straightforward thanks to both AWS Lambda and neon really you just focus on code uh and you just pass in in the case of neon you're going to have a database URL string that Express will consume using the neon servess package that works with JavaScript so it's actually fairly straightforward there are some moving parts so yeah you probably want to know some JavaScript to get this going but we'll talk about that in just a moment but that's a high level understanding of why Servo is in the first place it's far more effective it's far more efficient than managing a server yourself now of course if you're not ready to really scale up your application and you're not ready to build into this environment you can still bring around the expressjs application and your neon application or your neon database with you to wherever you want to deploy it doesn't have to be servess and so we actually do take a look at how to deploy this on for sale for that very reason is so you can see how portable it can be by leveraging a manage database service in this case a serverless one that ends up costing significantly less so I'm really excited get into this one so let's go ahead and take a look at this course let's talk about the requirements you'll need to do well in this course and then we'll also do a highle overview of what it is we're going to be using what technology we're going to be using now first and foremost this is a JavaScript heavy Series so that means that you need to know stuff like functions classes objects arrays string substitution handling promises and callbacks maybe even Json once you know that stuff in JavaScript then you can move to the next part which is using node.js or serers side JavaScript so be sure to install node.js grab 20 LTS so version 20 is the version we're going to be using but whatever version you end up using make sure it's an LTS one unless of course you know what you're doing but the idea here is we're going to be using nodejs to actually run our JavaScript so we'll create a Javascript file and then use node to run it now if you're from the browser world of JavaScript as in writing stuff like react or vanilla JS node.js is just on the server side your web browser won't run your JavaScript node.js will although they work basically the same which is one of the Magics of node.js so once we actually have our application running locally we'll start to deploy it to a serverless function called AWS Lambda now at a high level serverless just means that it runs when it needs to that's what we're going to be using Ed Lambda for and that's how they can offer things like 1 million requests free per month on their free tier which is amazing that's so many requests to pay $ Z for so the next part of this of course is not just running the actual code itself but Al also storing the data that we need to store and for that we're going to be using serverless postres for this thanks to neon neon is really pioneering the next generation of what post CR can be by implementing things like servess and many other features to make it a very very powerful offering for your applications this is very very straightforward as we'll see but the idea here is these are going to work int to have a fully seress application from the actual node.js side of it itself as well as our database is fantastic then to actually build and deploy the application we're going to be using GitHub and more specifically GitHub actions to have a serverless part of that as well that's going to handle so much of that so if you don't know git definitely brush up on that as well now finally the main part of AWS that we're going to be using really is awsam this is because of the the tools that we'll use we really just have to focus how to make the right policies to do the deployments itself we're not going to have to manually deploy to AWS Lambda because that's kind of tricky and it takes a long time to configure when we can really just automate the process and really only focus on the I am access the policies all of that that's one of the things that we'll be doing for sure so make sure that you already have an account on AWS and also that you already have an account on neon and all of those links are in the description of course and then definitely sign up for GitHub as well now a couple optional things that we'll do towards the end are deploying to versel so deploying to versel is going to basically take everything we did for AWS Lambda and then deploy it on versel and that's really where we're going to wrap things up to really just see how portable we can make this application and of course when we deploy to versale we will still be using neon our serverless database so that's going to be very very straight forward so we can see how we can really move the code around without doing much to our database which is really nice to to keep that Integrity now the final thing that's optional is actually using visual studio code or vs code this is the text editor I like using the most to me it's by far the best one that is also free so if you have one that you prefer by all means go ahead and use that one I'm going to be using visual studio code so with all those requirements out of the way let's go ahead and jump into actually building out our project of course with node.js already installed which we'll verify when we build out that project as well now when it comes to building for AWS Lambda one of the key things we have to think about is how do we actually even test or develop locally for a serverless function and the way we're going to do this is by using the serverless framework from serv.com now this framework is going to make it easy for us to test locally as well as deploy into production but before we even get there we need to jump into the AWS console to just verify which version of node.js we should even use I know I mentioned that we should download and install the LTS one in the last part but we want to verify that that LTS is even available in Lambda itself so if we go into AWS into Lambda you can do a quick search for Lambda as well we're going to go ahead and hit create function and in here we just want to look at the runtime and the run times that are available right now as we see there are a number of them on there I would say node and python are probably among the most popular ones there but the idea is node 20 is available and therefore the one that is the current LTS is also available so download what's available there so we can actually test it out locally and so in my case I've got the node version 20 There It Is I've got mpm 10 which comes in with node version 20 and then I've got the serverless framework is what I want to use to actually test out AWS Lambda we're also going to use serverless to create our project that's what we want to do now is we're going to use that package to create a project so to do this we're going to do NP PM install DG serverless and this will install that serverless package for us in my case I already actually have it installed so it's actually pretty fast but the idea then is once we have serverless there's a lot of different Frameworks that we can use from it so it has a lot of different features in here as well many of which we are not going to cover at all but this is what we're going to do we're going to create a new serverless project and then we're going to navigate into that directory and then we'll actually bring it into our vs code instance so to do this I'm going to navigate into a location where I like to store my projects which in my case is in the dev folder and we'll call serverless right here hit enter okay and so what we should see now is different kinds of serverless functions we might want to build out and so what I'm going to be doing is the express API one and this is just to get some pure expressjs built out for us or the package for us I'm going to go ahead and save that and I'm going to call this my serverless nodejs API okay and so it's going off of the node Express and all that I'm not going to register a login for the serverless framework I don't need to do that and I'm also not going to deploy right now in fact I don't really have a way to deploy yet and so we will worry about that when we get there uh but for now what I want to do is I want to navigate into this server list no. JS API and we're going to go ahead and open this up into vs code just like this and so I'll go ahead and start off and save this as a workspace and then I'll also do my get in it definitely want to make sure that I have that notice there's already a g ignore file in here so it's not something I need to worry about just yet next thing what I want to do is prepare this to work with the correct postgres so when it comes to postgres databases you need to have a client of some kind to connect to that postc database so traditionally speaking you might use something like node postgres node postgres is a fantastic package that makes it really easy for something like expressjs to connect to a postres database which works really well when the node application is continuously running even if it's updating and it has some downtime overall it would be continuously running right and so when it comes to something like AWS Lambda it's doing the opposite of that it's only running when it needs to run and therefore it's going to be down a lot and so that's where something like node postgres isn't well positioned to make that happen maybe at some point it will be but the thing is neon actually pioneered neon Serv list this actual database which is ideal for serous and Edge deployments using htps and websockets so that persistent connection can be interrupted on a regular basis because of these two things and therefore is very well suited for any kind of Ser lless including AWS Lambda and it also can use persistent connections because it's a drop-in replacement for that node postr package and it's also what this is based on but again it's designed for this modern serverless architecture that AWS Lambda has that we've seen in a lot of different places as well and so that's the actual package we'll end up using to connect to our database and of course our database is also provided by Neon but the idea here is we definitely need to use this postres package or this postes driver and client to be able to connect our expressjs application to it so let's go ahead and install this as well I'll go ahead and use the mpm install command as well so we'll install this into our application and while we're at it we're also going to go ahead and do mpm install DG and it's going to be the neon command line tool so we'll use this to use all sorts of things related to Neon and so with that installed I'll also go ahead and do neon CTL and off so I can actually log in to neon and verify my local machine on this to do all of these sorts of things which in my case I'll go ahead and authorize you can also use an API token which is something we will do when we get into the GitHub actions of it all and we can see where those credentials are saved right there okay so we now have our Baseline project set up right it's ready to go and overall there are still a few other installations that I want to bring in and those are related to how we connect to our database and how we manage databases schema so this is going to be done using drizzle o and drizzle kit both of these things will be installed right now so let's go ahead and install drizzle kit omm and and then we'll go ahead and install drizzle kit and to do this we'll do mpm install D capital D drizzle dkit and go ahead and install that as well which it might have actually done with Drizzle it did not so drizzle kit will be used as well to help us with our migrations the drizzle omm will help us design out our schema once we get to that portion but these are the main packages we're going to be using if we need to add any later we will uh but overall for right now this is what we're going to start with and we really need to see how to do a Hello World with this serverless package and see exactly what that's going to look like in conjunction with our neon database when we get there in a standard server environment the way you run expressjs is by modifying what we have here by using app. listen and then we can pass in some sort of Port value here and this port value then can have a callback function once it actually starts running and you can do something like console log and then running at HTTP col localhost 3000 right and so what this will allow us to do then is to open up our terminal and we can now run node index.js now before I even look at that I'll close it out and turn that off I'll comment that out again and run it again and we see it goes away this is actually a good way to think of serverless right so the first version this is going to continuously run no matter what the second version is running when we tell it to run and the way we restart the first version is well quite literally restarting the application itself and then making sure it runs so now we've got that let's go ahead and take a look at that homepage and we can do that by going into our web browser we could o up open up a new terminal window and we could just run curl HTTP col localhost and 3000 and that will give us the same response back great so that's showing us that expressjs is working and in some sense it's actually a hello world from expressjs but of course I want to make sure that my serverless app is actually working and I can use it locally so the way we do that of course is by commenting out this app. listen this is for like a server full app which we are not using right and so let's go ahead and close out this node index.js so what we want to do is we need to update our local environment to handle the offline mode from the serverless framework to do this we're going to go ahead and use serverless plugin install dashin serverless Das offline okay so once we install that it should open up and install something into package.json related to the serverless offline package and again this is for development mode so we can emulate what the actual AWS lamb serverless would end up doing and so to actually run this we can use server list offline now and that will trigger the exact same application and it's running at the same port in this case so if I went ahead and run this again I get the exact same value except now if it's going based off of an AWS Lambda event or it's emulating exactly what that is it even shows you the build duration for this request now another thing that's cool about this is it can also emulate different regions so if we wanted to run that with a different region so like region and US West one you could do that and that would actually show you this different region we can also do different different stages which allows us for a lot of options here so if I do region and or rather stage and prod and hit enter I have just another stage that I can work off of and of course we're going to build this out quite a bit more throughout this course but the idea now is I have a really quick and easy way to test this serverless application itself but there's still some things that I need to modify the first one is going to be package.json what I want in here is the scripts de definition so we can actually call out those scripts that we might want like Dev and this is going to be just simply serverless offline and you can add in the stage of let's go ahead and say Dev for example the region in this case doesn't really matter that much uh but I'll go ahead and leave it like that that way I can do mpm run Dev and then it's still the same thing and it's still working just as it was before but then I don't have to remember all of the commands related to this serverless offline that's a big part of the reason I use scripts like this there are other reasons as well but again we're just sort of preparing for development mode in this at this point so the next thing is going into serverless yaml so what you might see right off the bat is well yes it added this plugins here perhaps you looked at this file perhaps not if you haven't looked at this file we see this functions in here this function Handler we'll talk about that in a second but then I also have this big red flag which is this right here that is showing us the runtime node.js 18 this is not the runtime we want now now to remember what run times we have available to us we can log into the console on AWS and we can navigate into Lambda and then go into create function and going down to what's listed here right so we have other options on here now we've already talked about it but 20. X should be the runtime we are targeting here so we're going to go ahead and save that we'll run this again in this case it doesn't actually change anything it doesn't change anything technically from how this is running because node 18 and node 20 aren't a whole lot different but at the at the point of this is to make sure that our runtime is matching our development mode and our production mode that's really the point there the next one I want to do is change how my API Handler is working so the API Handler is really just looking for this index. Handler which in our case is coming from the servis application itself and then this module right here that's exporting Handler that is what we're end up using so we've got is index. Handler if I change this to app. Handler I would need to change index to app.js right and you might end up doing that now in my case what I usually do is I create a file called SRC so SRC a folder there and then I move my app inside of SRC now it's probably a good idea to just keep it in as just index.js our application itself is not going to get that complicated so we're going to leave it as index. JS but with this it actually separates my application code from a lot of the configuration for the project itself which is what I always always do and so back into this server. yaml we can now just change this Handler then into SRC do index. Handler right and so that's going based off of the folders themselves so let's go a and save that and let's try that again with this run Dev in this case I can go ahead and run it again and now I get a problem in here so let's go ahead and change the the actual handle and Handler to actually doing not DOT notation but using the folder itself and so we'll run it again this time it works correctly okay so that dot notation is the intuition I would typically use to run some sort of Handler like this but it's important to be able to test these things out try them out and see exactly how to configure this so now we can actually start developing with this serverless offline framework it's really just that simple I don't think there's a whole lot more we need to talk about this in terms of getting the serverless offline working now I will say that you could probably experiment with a lot of things related to just doing your server full app that's probably going to be okay and realistically I wonder if we could have that server full app in here with the Handler itself if that causes any issues and it doesn't appear so mostly because of the export itself the actual name space for that export is what's being used it's not actually calling index JS like this app Listen would end up doing so basically we have support for either one which is also pretty nice okay so now that we've got this let's go ahead and see how we can load in environment variables into our application right off the bat at this point in your coding Journey you probably realize that it's not a good idea to hardcode API Keys database strings or really any secret data right inside of the code itself it's much better to inject that when the code runs so have it done in the environment at itself and the way we're going to do that is by using a EnV file this is very very common to do in all sorts of programming languages but the idea here is in index.js if I did something like database URL we don't want to have the actual database URL string in here we want that to be abstracted away and so the way we're going to do this is by using process.env so what we have here is process. EnV do and then the environment variable we want to use in our case it's going to be database URL so if I save that as is and then run our serverless application our offline and then curl to it what I'll get is this hello world here looks like maybe I didn't save anything so let me try that again with that curl I'm still not getting anything for this so let's go ahead and actually change this a little bit more and then go ahead and say something like not here okay so now we've got if it is there it will be set otherwise we'll just have it as not here we'll go ahead and re run our lless application and now I get this database URL not here of course this is just a fallback value not something we'll necessarily use for much longer but the idea is that we want to actually have this work and so that's what we'll do now now traditionally speaking you might use something like theb package this is a fantastic package and is used a ton so this is something you would absolutely consider using when it comes to well non AWS Lambda Services we want to prepare it for aw Lambda and the way we're going to do that is by using the server list. EnV plugin it's a fairly straightforward plugin and it allows for a lot of different support as we'll see right now so the idea is we want this database URL to work and the way we can do that is by coming into our server. gaml and we can Define our environment and so in this environment I can add in our database URL here and I could set it equal to EnV colon as in the environment colon and then the actual value value we want to set from the EnV file like that I can also have a fallback like that okay great so this is sort of configuring it but we still need to add in the plugin itself so let's go ahead and close out this server and now we're going to go ahead and run serverless plugin install dasin serverless dv- plugin hit enter and this will install something in our serverless Di gaml as well as package.json will be this right here and so now that we've got that we can come back into Ser yaml we see that this is one of the plugins that's available to us which of course will be very useful when we actually push this into production then I also want to add in use. EnV being true so we'll go ahead and save that and I just want to see if the fallback value shows up if the EnV value shows up or if the inline code value shows up so let's go ahead and try this out by running it again I don't need to reinstall I'll just go ahead and run mpm run Dev and then we'll run our curl command and we got something else in here so what's happening in in our serverless DL it's fallback value is actually not being used but rather the EnV value is being used so at this time in my get ignore I want to actually add in EnV here with a star at the end because what I can also do is EnV let's say for instance DOD as in my development mode this is another value that I might have so we'll go ahead and say Dev DB right and so then if I wanted to use this Dev mode here I could go in package.json and quite literally change the stage to Dev mode which I still have it's actually on that stage so this Dev right here if I called it Dev ABC I would want to change this EnV to Dev ABC type of thing right so that stage is how I can actually modify this a little bit which which is also super nice and it actually will help prepare us and for our local environment for our staging environment and then finally for our production environment we could quite literally have all of those environment variables in here and then just call the different stage to run the different environment variable which we can test out really quickly right now what we see is that database URL coming through fantastic so the next thing is like maybe we want to add in another environment variable I'm going to go ahead and say debug and we're going to set this equal to one so this is now in myv back into serverless iaml I'm going to go ahead and do something similar um and this time I'll go ahead and say debug and we'll go ahead and come in here this time I'm to give the fallback value of zero and so now in index.js I'll go ahead and add that in as well and debug and this time I'll just go ahead and leave it like that save it and actually I'll go ahead and say it's equal to one so debug being equal to one based off ofv let's go ah and save that we'll restart everything and let's run it again this time I'll curl again and what we've got is false right so EnV is not equal to one let's go ahead and see if it's equal to or what it is equal to let's just console log it like that I'll go ahead and restart the application itself we'll run it and my console log is one what the what just happened here well let's actually try it or equal to the string of one and let's see what that looks like so go ahead and just put it in as a string value here and maybe we wrap this whole thing in a string as well now let's go ahead and try this again rerun this and run that again and now we get true so the actual values themselves are often going to be treated as a string itself so you need to be aware that when you're going through and using environment variables inside of your express application um now there are more advanced usages of the actual uh you know plug-in itself which I do encourage you to go into the serverless Frameworks plug-in documentation for that and you can see all of the advanced usage that's in here but generally speaking what we want to know about are three main things one is we have to define the environment variables in ser. yl that we're going to use in our application two we can use different EnV files to actually load in those environment variables and those EnV files can be as simple as just the standard EnV or of course based off of Any Given stage that we might want to have Dev test prod V1 V2 and then each stage can still inherit from that base. EnV which means that we don't have to rewrite all of the same variables over and over and over again like in the case of debug maybe we just want it always to be one so that all of the other stat PES can just go based off of one CU we're in our local development environment and especially because these EMV files would never be committed to the git repo and then of course in the final one our code itself needs to be aware of when the actual data types don't work as you might expect so that's another thing that's just to be aware of when it comes to using those environment variables and so at this point we now have a way to test out our application altogether notice that when I did change the EMV Dev the actual stage environment variable then the actual value came through so this actually overrode what was in the first one the EnV itself uh which Al is also pretty nice great so now that we've got this we have we're really just ready to start actually using that database URL we start the integration process with our neon postgres database so let's start that process now now we're going to take a look at neon serverless postres now what I want to show you here is the console on neon so we can really highlight what branching is all about it's that point in time snapshot of our database that we can essentially use a brand new copy of it isolated from the original one which is great for production applications and then staging instances or versions of our application and it happens really really quickly so of course we get all the benefits of serverless as well so it actually scales down to zero and then it'll scale up to meet demand as well our application needs it now the latency to actually scale from 0 to 1 one is surprisingly incredibly fast with neon as well so go ahead and go to neon.pdf versions as well I'm going to go ahead and use the default database name but feel free to change this as you see fit the last most important part is the region itself this region should be as near to your application as possible now in our case we're going to be using the default which is Us East Ohio at least that's my default and the reason for this is because it's going to be where we deploy our application on AWS and of course that region of Ohio is where we're deploying to us East to in AWS which will come back back to once we actually deploy that but the idea here is we want to start off with our database being in that region now it's actually really easy to create a new project with a new region so if you have to you could always just use whatever region is physically closest to you right now and then then when you actually start deploying your application you'll go ahead and change the region then okay so at this point let's go ahead and create that project and what we get right out of the gates is a connection string this is a postrest connection string that gives us our username our password our host our database and a few other configuration items now the other thing that's really cool about this when you first start out is you've got a lot of options for integration in here right and there is one for node.js but we are actually not going to use this integration option we don't need to for a number of reasons one of them being that we will just use that connection string that's what we want so basically what we'll do is copy this string whatever it ends up being you can click copy right here and then you'll bring it back into your local project into the environment vers variables when we did the EnV stuff and you'll paste this in and this is what we'll end up loading in once we get there for now I'm going to leave it just as a you know the original D Dev DB thing uh but the idea being that eventually we'll use this string for now though what I want to do is I actually want to play around with branching inside of our project so let's go ahead and close out this window here of course we can still get all of that data right in the dashboard also but what we want to do is we want to actually insert some data into our database now of course if we look at our tables here we have no tables yet there's really nothing in our database so let's go ahead and add some just by using the SQL editor that just gives us some default code that we can just run that will actually insert some data in for us and so what we'll see is if I go back into the tables tab I now see there's a table in here in which I can select and actually see the data that's coming through from that and so we could also just run that a few more times by going into our history here I can just run a couple lines here by selecting it I'm going to run that run it again run it again just so we have some more data that we are playing with just like that so I've got 40 rows in here right now so let's take a look at the magic of branching so if I go in this branches area here I'm going to go ahead and create a new branch and I'm going to call this my Dev Branch so current point and time that's what we're going to go off of but notice we've got other options in here we can also select which branch we want to be the parent the one that we're basically copying from I'm going to go ahead and create this new Branch from my main branch cuz that's the only one I have and now I get another connection string this is a different version of the exact same data but it's a brand new and unique connection string that I can use in my project specifically for like a Dev branch that has a lot of the same data so let's actually just verify that real quick by going back into that SQL editor and now what we want to do is just switch our branches to our Dev Branch I'm going to goe and run those two lines once again and now I'm going to go run it and let's run it again and what we'll see is if I go into my tables once again I'll change the brancher make sure that I'm on a new Branch I'll select the table that I just was playing with I'll scroll to the bottom and notice that I have 60 items in here now and if I were to go back into the main branch which I can do that quickly select it again and now we see once again the main branch Stills back at that 40 amount of items or 40 rows in there um and it happens just that quickly but the other thing that's great about this is if at any time we feel like deleting this I'll just go ahead and copy the name go ahead and delete this delete it now that project is completely deleted so what we can do of course is just bring it right back now of course this is going to be an empty project with empty databases but overall it's the same configuration just it doesn't have the data and I can spin it back up that quickly so of course actually bringing this back to what we just looked at I would just need to go back into that SQL editor and create those tables of course before I created tables I could just verify that yeah it actually is an empty database which no surprise it is you know like that kind of makes sense but the idea being that if I come back into the SQL editor I were to run it again and maybe again and let's say for instance I wanted to create a new Branch once again I'll go into branches create a new Branch Dev Branch from the main branch I go and create that and then we'll go ahead and go into well let's create another Branch we'll create one from the dev Branch we'll go ahead and do Dev V2 right you can create as many branches as you really need I mean my project in this case has a limit of 10 but you're probably never going to go past 10 that would be surprising if you ever did but the idea of course is that we have all these different branches so I can go back into the SQL editor once again and run a few commands for the various branches that I see fit and it just is that fast it's it's so cool uh and it makes things really really easy and granted there's a lot of other configurations we might consider like new roles new database is these things get a little bit more advanced on the postgres side itself but overall there are other options that we can Implement now one of the main ones that we want to implement is well basically doing these things in an automated fashion and we will do that using the command line tool later the neon command line tool that will actually build up our branches it will do the branching for us it won't necessarily run SQL directly with the command line tool because that's not what we're going to be using it for instead you'll use a connection string to run the various SQL commands itself and then what we will also do is we'll implement the API keys so inside of developer settings here we're going to generate a new API and then use the command line tool specifically for that so that so much of what we just did will be automated you can also even automate the project itself which is something we're not going to do but we will automate the process of branching because it is a fundamental part that really just unleashes a lot of value that we can provide to to our development process right so whenever I need to actually have a Dev version or Dev V2 I can still use production data if I want to or I can just build out data that I need just for local testing and that data could be in its own branch of our original database and so then when we run migrations we can migrate each database as we see fits as in change the structure of the database whenever we need to on each branch as well so that parts also pretty cool but overall the idea here is if you actually let it sit for a little bit longer what's going to happen is these are not going to be active anymore and so that the actual databases will be ready to be used but they'll just become inactive and then actually reusing them or making any sort of call on these databases we'll spin them back up to meet the demand that you need as we'll see as well once we actually start implementing this database uh into our project so at this point go ahead and clean up the branches delete the ones that you don't need I'm going to be going just off of the main branch and we'll start integrating that into our project here in just a little bit let's take a look at how to use the neon command line tool to automate generating branches as well as getting our connection strings and then of course deleting branches when we need so the way we're going to do this is by starting from scratch we're going to create a brand new project I already deleted that project and then of course we're going to use the command line tool which there's a lot of documentation on it we're only really scratching the surface here and doing a few of the primary actions that I've been using using so to do this we want to make sure that the neon CTL is installed in my case it is and then I can also use just straight up neon and if you remember we used this mpm install DG neon CTL that was actually how I went about installing it now at one point I will use something called JQ which really just helps me parse Json data as you'll see and to install that it's Brew install JQ this is absolutely optional but it's one more thing that you could can potentially use to automate okay so once you actually have it installed you definitely want to run through neon CTL o now I already actually authenticated this I did all of this earlier so if you haven't done that go ahead and do that now and make sure that you have access to your local project now in my case if I actually go into neon CCL projects and list hit enter what I will see is absolutely nothing I actually deleted my project and it's really simple so to create one let's go ahead and create one real quick with a name here and I'm going to call this serverless and node js- API now this name flag there are it's pretty straightforward as far as how to create something I go ahead and create it and there we go I get all of the data that I might want including our connection URI or connection string that we can use to actually connect to this we're not going to use that yet instead what we're going to do is just delete this project I'm going to go aad and copy this uh Restless rice here and we'll go ahead and do neon CTL projects delete and use that ID and that will actually delete that project itself so then when I go to list everything out again I get nothing right and so that's really that simple to create a project and delete a project being that it is that simple we need to be aware that yes you could absolutely accidentally D delete a project that you didn't want to delete but in our case we're going to stick with just this for now and so I have my project created and I already have this connection URI now what I can do is I can actually run neon CTL and connection string hit enter and this will give me that same connection string right and so I can use this within the psql the actual local client that I have I can use that connection string and it's psql not pqsl but we can use that connection string just like that and it will allow me to jump into this like something like select now and I can run that and it'll give me the exact time that it is and we can quit out of here in a number of different ways you can write out quit you can write out exit it's actually pretty flexible as to how postgres works these days so that's the connection string so let's go back up there it is and so I can use it in many different ways now the other idea is if we needed another Branch right so if we were going to create a branch let's take a look at that so neon CTL and then branches G and actually let's go ahead and do branches list first we can see all of these things so to me the format works much like kubernetes if you're familiar with that but the idea is you get the neon CTL or just neon the actual resource that you're looking for and then the action you want to do right so it's going to be get list delete right or create and then in this case so we've got branches and if we do get let's go and grab this ID here and paste it in we get that particular Branch if we go neon CTL branches create well let's go and create a new one I'll go ahead and just write out Dev unknown command Dev now just like with our project we use D- name and hit Dev and then we get a name so the name and the ID are not the same right so we've got the ID here which what do you know that ID is also corresponding to the actual connection string itself but once again if I go to list out all of the branches I can see the various branches in here if I do neon and CTL branches git let's say Dev once again now I can actually call Dev right so when I go to create it I need to pass in the name argument if I don't create it I don't have to do that the other thing is when we create one let's go ahead and just not have a name argument at all and what do you know it actually creates one for us so it'll actually come up with our its own name and we can list all of those things out just like that so then if we want the connection string we can use neon CTL connection string and then pass in the branch that we're looking for so we can use the autogenerated one that the name and the ID look to correspond or we can use our own let's go ahead and use Dev in this case that Branch should be different than the main branch right and enough it is right so the user that's being created is not different and we could absolutely create a different users to actually run this connection which you can just verify inside of here as well there's these different roles in here that you can create for any given user that takes some extra that we'd have to do in the post side as far as their permissions and whatnot whereas this user has full permission to the database itself um but the idea here is now we can create branches really quickly we can create connection strings really quickly and then of course we can actually use those connection strings so in the case of Linux and Mac you can export let's say for instance our database URL we can set this equal to that neon command so neon CTL connection string and then you could do our branch of Dev something like that you hit enter that will run that command now I can use this connection string with the psql like this and let's make sure that we have this in double quotes actually not single quotes and there we go so now I'm actually able to connect and hide the database URL as that is one of those key things that you would want to do and so when it comes to postes itself the different clients actually downloading installing psql is something that I I recommend you do if you want to learn more about postgres itself so using that SQL editor like we saw before we had all of this stuff I can absolutely do that inside of postes SQL right so I'd go line by line to just make it simple we've got this example here we created that table and then I can go ahead and bring in some of those values again once again it's doing that and then I can select all and see all of those values right here so that's really how you can do the second part of what we were doing within the console itself of the SQL editor you would actually have to use a postgres client of some kind now we can do a lot of these same sort of things within the actual JavaScript itself we could call SQL queries inside of the JavaScript itself as we'll see here very shortly but the idea overall is that we have the ability to automate so much of this being able to create branches on a whim is really great because then when we are actually committing our code we could create those branches get the connection strings and deploy it wherever we need to with that stage and all that so it just really lends really well for Automation and staging purposes for many many different stages which is why I wanted to show you this now again this is foundational for what we'll do later but overall I recommend playing around with this and being comfortable with just deleting a assets whenever you feel like it so in the case of our project neon projects right so we can do neon projects list rather and we can go ahead and delete this project and then start to get right so neon project delete and you get that ID now in this case I only have the ability to create one project let's go ahead and just try create hit enter notice it creates one for me I try to create another one I got my limit exceeded right so I can really only create one project but within that project you can create multiple databases um as you could you know experiment with on your own in there as well so if you wanted a multiple databases what you would with multiple brand brch is what you would do is you would have multiple branches each branch can have its own database itself so the project had can have multiple branches each branch can have multiple databases or they can just have all the same sort of things uh so that's pretty cool as well so yeah if you have any questions on the neon command line tool definitely consult this reference here there's a lot that it's just a matter of playing around with it uh to get the most out of it and then of course downloading and installing some sort of post client so you can really get your hand diry with a SQL if that's what you're wanting to do and if you're not wanting to do that if you're wanting to get using JavaScript that is what we need to do now it's time to actually integrate our neon uh connection string that database URL and also the neon seress package into our nodejs application so we can do a lot of these things with now heavy JavaScript so let's take a look at how to do that now we're going to go ahead and integrate our node.js application with our neon postgres database the key part of all of this is the fact that we are using serverless so the way we approach it has to be from a serverless perspective and that's how we have to configure things which means that we're going to be using the very specific package of neon database serverless there are a lot of postes packages out there to integrate with node.js specifically no- postes could be one that you would end up using but the important part for us as we've said before is that we are using seress and we need to use the neon version of that seress so the first thing that I want to do is I want grab that database URL wherever that might be so in my case you can go into the neon console grab the database URL that's right here or we can use the neon CTL connection string as well right so you could always create a new project if you don't already have one I'm going to go ahead and grab this connection string right here and bring it into my EnV Dev file not justv but rather just dodev so with this in mind I'll go back into index.js and now I need to start configuring fing out my database client so I'm going to go and create a function called DB client and what we really want to do is we want to return for the moment just the database URL itself from the process so I'll go a and return that and so now what we want is our DB client is basically equal to that so const um let's go ahead and call this our DB is equal to that database client that's roughly speaking where we're going with this so to actually make this work we need to start integrating the neon database serverless so this package itself and so at this point I already have it installed and if you don't just go ahead and run that npm install if you once again we already have that database URL we just set that up next we need to use it so this is how we're going to use it don't worry about the actual SQL command that's right here we're not going to look at that one instead we're going to go ahead and use these two items right here so let's paste this into index.js and before we go any further I'm I'm going to go ahead and use this down in the DB client instead so that's really what I want to return is that SQL command from neon and that's the point of having that so this DB client then I can run different commands directly from it itself so we could do something like con results equals to DB with these back ticks it's really cool that you can use these back ticks and you can do select and now just like we've seen before this should give us some sort of result that we can then pass in to our API request okay so one thing that's important to note is this right here let's go ahead and actually try and run this if you recall we have mpm runev inside of our package.json to go with our serverless offline specifically with the stage of Dev which is why I put it into EnV dodev so let's go a and run that again and so what we'll get when we actually go to the endpoint of Local Host 300 000 is we cannot use an import statement outside of a module so by default we do not have a standard module we have commonjs so it's just a slight difference which means that we just need to change this from importing to being a constant and using require and if you wanted to convert it to a model module you could but that takes extra configuration that we're just not going to cover at this time instead we're going to go ahead and use the commonjs which is what is traditionally been used by expressjs in a lot of these node.js applications but now that we've got that we should be able to use this just fine so I'll go ahead and refresh in here and now I get something it's not necessarily exactly what I wanted but it is something now why is it not actually giving me what I want to see this is because we need this to be all asynchronous so the database client itself we want to change this to being async which which means that down here we need to change our call back Handler for the route itself that also needs to be in a sync right so if you think of how any given route Works inside of expressjs it is also a function so we can say like our index route and by default it comes in with the request the response next and this function itself could then handle all of the things from that function it could go like this and like that right so we can absolutely separate these things out like this that's just not a common pattern to use with the nodejs application itself you usually just put the call back right in there and so putting a sync in front of it is the same thing as putting async in front of a normal function itself now if you didn't know that that's what's going on because now that it's asynchronous we can now await our database client and then within our database client to actually use it we can await it as well and to really follow follow a little bit closer to the convention you could also just call this SQL as well and so that kind of fits a little bit more with what you'll see throughout the documentation on the SQL client itself directly from the neon database server list which is what we do see in the docs itself that's this right here so as you can see it says await and that's how we're actually able to do that is by making everything a synchronous and so now we should actually see some sort of result that goes into the actual database itself so back into our Local Host we rerun this and we should see something that is coming from our database now the first time we run it it might take a moment because our actual database on the neon console has to be active for it to work and so that first little bit of latency does make a difference now I'm also using a database that's in Us East it's quite literally on the other side of the country than me so how fast it's gone is really really great so it should in the speed should improve quite a bit when I actually deploy this application into AWS Lambda and so we've got here as results that actually is an array here with some data and that that's just what happens from this particular command so we can actually unpack the results like this if I refresh that that should give me a dictionary value I might need to refresh the server itself um or what we could do in here let's go ahead and run that again refresh in here now now it's a dictionary value now I can actually just do results. now and we might have to refresh the server once again so let's go ahead and try that out and I refresh and there are my results this is now a timestamp that's coming directly from the database like we saw when we were in the SQL editor itself and we ran you know select now just like that it's the exact same command going to the exact same database and return R turning roughly the same value of course it's changing just for however long I need to actually look at this um so yeah now we are fully integrated with our neon database inside of our node.js application so that means we can start doing a lot of more interesting things before we do that I want to point out this right here is raw SQL so this command what you can do with a weight SQL now is you could write out your own raw SQL so if you wanted to experiment with how you know SQL itself you could create an endpoint that would in theory accept data to run various SQL commands in other words you can create an endpoint that handles a form very similar to what we see inside of the console itself that's not something I want to do I want to make sure that the commands I am running are exactly to the structure that I want them to be I don't want to have pure SQL commands running through in my application at least that's not how I want to design this one right so now that we've got this all integrated there is one more thing that I want to add in to the configuration for neon and this just has to do with the connection itself when we go into our deployed serverless environment I want to just change the configuration to use an experimental feature called Fetch connections cache and we're going to set that being equal to true this is for HTTP connections and nonp pooling right that's really what's going on here feel free to look at the documentation themselves but we're not going to have pooling in a serverless environment because that server is going to be scaled down so it's it's a little bit more difficult to pull connections when they aren't persistent it's going to cause a lot of havoc and issues so that's why we're going to be using HTTP connections and that's also why I put that configuration just to make sure that that's in there well before we actually go into production itself pretty great now we're going to do our first deployment of our node.js application of course using the serverless framework to make sure that it runs into AWS Lambda now to make this work I'm going to go ahead and use this command seress but instead of saying serverless offline I want to do something different so we'll give it a new script name of deploy and then we'll go ahead and use serverless deploy and then the stage we want to deploy and of course that stage is going to work very similar to the offline where it has maybe in its own environment variable so let's actually change the stage to Simply prod and so now to run this I'm going to go ahead and run npm run deploy and of course it's going to run this command in here one of the big benefits of writing the script in here like this is that you don't have to remember what different flags you're going to be adding for different deployment options in this case the stage of prod will always be the stage whenever I run npm run deploy and so what we've got here is we've got loading environment variables from EnV so it's going to look into the EnV here and then it would look into dodev if that was the stage so if we wanted to add in ourr stage we could do that just like that and so now let's go ahead and add in just another key in here so hello world equal to this something like that we go ahead and run the deplo deploy again and we can see the different environment variables that are coming through in here and so of course it fails to deploy it for a number of reasons one of them the security token is invalid so at this point I have credentials on my local machine but they're not the valid ones and so I also have this Us East one in here so two kind of major issues that we want to address we want to verify that this is the correct region and in package.json I can actually bring in that flag of region and in this case I'll leave it in as us East one now the question of course is going to be how do we know which region we want to use well it has everything to do with our database we want to make sure that the region is as close as it as it can possibly be and so to do that we can use neon CTL and we can go ahead and do projects list and we can see the project that we're using and the the region ID which is Us East 2 we can ignore AWS Dash because Us East 2 is the AWS region itself so we can update this region to being that region itself and then we can run deploy again and this time it's going to attempt to do it in the correct region which is exactly what we were hoping for so the security credentials we need to address but before we do that I want to bring your attention to something important and interesting so yes it is deploying using this.r right so it's going to use all of these environment variables and it's going to build something and go and do what exactly well what it's happening is it's building this dot serverless folder inside of our local repo so it builds this folder out and then creates this zip file here so what we could do is we could actually unzip this ZIP file and we could take a look at what happens so inside of my project here I can actually see what do you know it's actually everything related to my repo my main code in itself is zipped up and brought into here it's actually Mi missing the EnV files so it doesn't actually have those things in there which is pretty nice and fairly important right and it also doesn't have the doget ignore so it is missing some things but it does have all of the node modules in there so it's kind of like a point in time instance of the application itself but it's also showing me something in this state file and that is all of my environment variables now on one hand this is great it actually uses my.pro and it's just going to go ahead and do that and I can just deploy this application and in theory this will just run which is nice but the thing is this state file is well it has our database URL directly in the state file so this is a security con concern for sure because we will show you where this is going to end up in just a moment so to make it end up where it needs to we need to actually update our credentials so if you've used the AWS CLI before you'll know that most of the time you'll log in there and it'll create something inside of a. AWS credentials in your application and you'll see something like this now these credentials in my case are no longer valid in general but they're also not valid to actually do the deployment they're not valid to actually use serverless serverless itself needs its own policies and its own credentials to be able to deploy everything well maybe it doesn't need its own credentials but ideally with each project you attach different policies and then create credentials for them now if you're not familiar with this process I'm definitely going to show you but before I show you I want to just show you this reference that we have here for this I am policy so this is a policy we're going to be using for the serverless framework it's pretty extensive one of the things that's important is when you you actually use this policy you want to change the AWS ID to the correct one for your account which is something we will do in just a moment but the idea is once you actually have those the permissions in place then in your EnV for example you'll have something called AWS uh access key ID and then AWS secret access key cool so we need to set these up let's go ahead and create these now to do this I'm going to go into IIM and I'm going to create a user group this group I'm going to just call it serverless framework okay just naming it calist framework and then we'll go ahead and create this group Next I'm going to go and create a user and I'll go ahead and create this user as serverless framework user realistically I would actually probably want to give it the name of my project so serverless nodejs API just like that we do not need to give them access to the Management console but what we do need to give them access to is the permissions that will'll add to this group so I'm going to go ahead and add into the serverless framework I'm going to add this user into that group Next what I want to do is we can review and create this user so let's go ahead and create them so all I did there was create a new user and add it to the group that I just created at this point they have no permissions and they also don't have any security credentials so going back into our user we go into security credentials and we'll go ahead and create a brand new access key go ahead and create this key we'll hit other and then I'll go ahead and say next and this is going to be our uh we don't actually need a description tag it unless you really want to here are those access keys I'm going to go ahead and copy this one uh the first one is the access key ID the next one is the secret and we'll paste that in there the names of these have to be exactly this the actual keys are going to be different of course but the actual AWS access key ID it has to be in this format it has to be written just like this now you could use it inside of credentials as well but the reason I'm using it into. EnV is so it doesn't conflict with my system at large and so I want to once again run my mpm run deploy and hit enter so this time what it's going to do is it's going to attempt to use these environment variables credentials but one of the problems is it's actually loading these into my environment as well this is definitely going to be causing an issue very very soon but now our new error is a little bit different it says that it's not authorized to perform this data so the user I just created is right here so that is the user we want to give permission to be able to perform all of the things that serverless wants to do and the reason this is working is because it's in the EnV itself this right here so now we need to give those permissions we actually need to create that policy so again in the actual GitHub repo itself you can go through and see this exact same policy I'm going to go ahead and copy it the repo is right here um and it will be linked in the description as well and so in my case I'll go ahead and create this policy reference and it's policy. Json I'm going to paste it in here I'm actually going to add this to get ignore because I do not need to commit this so I'll add it to get ignore and what we want to do is we want to change this AWS ID here so I'll do a command F or control F and we want to do a finding replace and I'll do a colon in front and back of it so we want to change that all across the board and the way we're going to do that is by finding the actual AWS ID for our account inside of I am so if I go ahead and close this out for the user go into the IM am dashboard we can see the account ID right here I'll go ahead and copy that and then we'll go ahead and replace it inside of this policy and we'll just do replace all just to make sure that our account ID ideas in here now you could in theory use just a star here but I like narrowing this down to specifically the account in the case of this particular policy so that if I were to reuse it again in the future I actually review it before I use it um and that's the idea okay so I will say that the permissions themselves if you were wanting to remove permissions you totally could but that might cause problems when it comes to the serverless framework itself that you'd have to look into even more but now that we've got this policy let's go ahead and create it by going back into the I am into policies here create policy and I'm going to go ahead and click on the Json and we'll go ahead and paste this in and so now I've got that policy in there with I think everything that we'll need I did test this a number of times so let's go ahead and create this policy now and I'll just call this the serverless framework uh permissions policy and then notice that it has very limited access I'll goad and create this policy and we want to attach this to either our user or our group I'll go ahead and attach it to the group click on the group itself click on permissions click on ADD permissions attach policies and do a quick search for the policy we made so the serverless framework policy I'll go ahead and attach that now the important thing about using permissions and policies within aw is you can attach too much permission right so the admin access gives quite literally all access to all AWS Services which could get you into trouble you could accidentally provision way too many things and cause a lot of Havoc within your account and charges as well and of course that also means that you maybe accidentally exposed your access keys and all that so the policy we're using is really limited to what the serverless framework needs to do it doesn't have unlimited policies just a few which is why we created our own and it's why it's working in this way so at this point we now have all the policies in place to run what we need to run within our serverless framework but before we do I will say the policy itself if for some reason the policy is not working we have inside of the gist itself for the policy reference we do have a gist available for you uh that will have the latest up-to-date information related to this policy and the servess framework so be sure to check that out that's going to be linked in a lot of different places uh but the idea being that the we use needs to actually work for everything we're trying to do here so with that out of the way let's go ahead and actually run our deployment here right so we go ahead and do mpm run deploy hit enter and so this will attempt to deploy this now with all those policies in place and so since it's going to deploy or attempt to I'm also going to go ahead and create another script in here and we're going to call this remove so deploying and removing are basically two sides of the same coin it's really just that simple to deploy it and then turn around and remove it I'm going to let this finish it might take a minute or a little bit more depending on our speed and everything that's going on in the AWS configuration uh but I'll go ahead and let this finish and then we'll come back and actually test out that deployment it's not quite done yet but it did say just a moment ago that it was uploading to S3 so since that just finished I want to actually look at S3 to see what that means exactly so if I do a quick search in here for S3 inside AWS we go click on S3 and then in here the buckets themselves I want to search for serverless and what we see here is our serverless application right there so this is going to be autogenerated for us that's what the serverless framework does it will autogenerate these buckets for us yes we could designate our own buckets but that configuration is a number of steps that we're just not going to cover so the idea here is we can click on this bucket we can click on serverless we can look at our project the stage that we're deploying the actual commit of the stage and then all of that same sort of data the Json State and all this so if I click on this state once again if I go ahead and open this I will see that there's my database URL and I also have my AWS access keys in here that's not great either so all of these things we we definitely want to move towards getting rid of and so we actually might have an error in our deployment because of our AWS access keys and sure enough by the time I said that we do so we definitely do not want to have these access keys inside of our deployment now I wanted to show you this error because it's related to ourv so we're kind of at this weird spot it's like well I need to use these keys but I also don't want to deploy them so how do I actually handle that well luckily for us serverless diagel has the ability to do this so what we can do is we can actually customize what environment variables will be submitted to our backend so if we do custom and then and then exclude we can actually put a list of enir environment variables that we don't want so like the AWS access key here and the secret key here we can do all of that and it's really just that simple every once in a while we might have to use something like this AWS session token and you know we also will get to a point where we want to remove the database URL we're not quite there yet but we will have that for now so with this in mind I have some changes that I made I'm going to go ahead and run this deploy again uh notice that these are still coming up so it looks like maybe I did something wrong and this should say exclude so I canel that out and we'll write it again now those environment variables are gone the ones that we just simply don't want anymore great so this is exactly what we want so once again it's uploading and we can see once it's done that progress so we go into prod here it's going to show us a new folder based off of that and it's also based off of the time itself so this one looks to be a little bit later so I'd imagine this is the more recent recent one and sure enough it it's already uploaded I can verify the state once again open this up and once again the things that I'm okay with exposing for now are exposed um and the other ones are not and so once this actually finishes we will actually test out this Lambda function um and we can also review the function itself inside of Lambda which is something I'll leave for you to just explore on your own uh but for now I'll I'll wait for this to finish and there it is it's fully deployed so if I go to this URL here let's open it up in the web browser just to make it a little bit easier to see it might take a moment to spin up but once it does it's going to be really really fast as we see here so there it is and of course we can also curl this out and get the same results from it it has the timestamp that's coming directly from the database itself which is what this is right and it also is using the environment variable for that database URL which of course is not as secure as we want so what we need to do is move this towards being a lot more secure than it currently is and that's definitely something we will do um in the next part but overall what we see here is we removed ourv variables we can deploy really simply using basically the same things we've been doing with the offline then our policy this is the part that's going to be the trickiest to get configured and set up and working correctly if at any point you need to change things you need to test what policy problems are happen happening you can always go into I am and go into the policy directly and let's go ahead and search for it Ser a list click on this since we have Json in here now if I go to edit this I can navigate to any block section so let's say for instance our S3 isn't working correctly like this put but bucket tagging let's say for instance that wasn't on there and it showed you there was some issue with that what you could do is go into that one single block notice that over here it says edit statement now I can actually look for various statements so like put um tag or let's go ahead and just type out tag and we can scroll down here and we can see put job tagging put bucket tagging put object tagging we can just add these things in really simply like that into this one statement and then it would actually adjust as as it needs to so this is a good way that you could really experiment with what's absolutely necessary when you go through and start building things out so for example let's just try this out I'm going to go ahead and get rid of this describe right here so I want to just refresh real quick um and I'm going to go ahead and edit out just one single permission so we can see what that error might look like right so we're going to come in here it looks like I'm still editing I'm going to go ahead and get rid of this describe star I'll go a and cut that out for the cloud formation stack itself we'll hit next and we'll go ahead and hit save changes I now removed a pretty major permission so going back in into my local project here I'll now run mpm run remove which will of course attempt to remove this and right off the bat I get not authorized to perform this describe stack resource so I can't even do anything here as far as deleting it so that alone will stop it in its tracks for any given user and so I can actually go ahead and come back and change that once again by going back into cloud formation and bringing that back in and that one single permission allows me to do describe which we could also verify by going into the statement itself we can go to cloud formation and describe as soon as you put describe there it will describe all of these things so describe star does all of these actions right here which is why they're highlighted and selected because of this if I remove that and come back and type out describe I can see that none of them are selected so it's actually kind of nice that I can I can go about doing that whenever I need to okay so we definitely want to bring that back in I don't need to do it manually I'll just write in that one single change save everything and now we'll go ahead and attempt to remove this and it might take a moment for it to be fully propagated as far as the description but right a bit right away it it happens really really quick basically and so getting in the habit of deploying and removing is perfectly okay because our code itself is being tracked by git so we don't have to really worry about our code our actual database itself is not being managed by serus at all the only thing that's being managed by serus in relation to the database at this time is the database URL but very soon that is going to be abstracted away to something a lot more secure but overall the idea here is being able to deploy and remove really really quickly at a moment's notice and having the correct permissions to be able to do that for your AWS user and so you could also practice right now just take a pause practice right now and actually remove access to this particular user and see if you can recreate access because it's fairly straightforward um but if you don't know how to do it then this is a good time to practice that before we move into securing that database URL a little bit more so let's take a look at that now if you're ready now we're going to go ahead and configure our database URL to be more secure by using the AWS systems manager so if you do a quick search for systems manager inside of AWS we're going to go ahead and configure this to work with our application and more specifically through the parameter store of the AWS systems manager now this is not the only place that you can store Secrets or variables that you want to encrypt but it is one of the best ways to do it so we're going to go ahead and create this parameter here and we're going to start off with Slash I'm going to say project name slash stage and then SLV name something like that that's kind of the format how I think about creating these parameters themselves so what I'm going to do is this is going to be called the serverless and nodejs API the stage itself we'll just use prod and then I'll go ahead and do database URL that's it so this path right here is something we will use in the future so let's go ahead and grab it into index.js I'm going to go ahead and do const and this is going to be my um database URL SSM pram and we'll pass that in okay so that's just the name that we'll have next up we need the database URL itself so I'll go ahead and use the Neon command line tool for the connection string and we'll go ahead and place that in here I'll copy that and we will then place that inside of our parameter itself so we've got our name we can use this standard tier we're going to use a secure string so it encrypts this data and then we're going to go ahead and use our current account we don't need to change any of these things you can use all of the defaults the next thing is just going to be the value that we want to encrypt and then I'm going to go ahead and create this parameter so it's encrypted at rest so if I go go and look at it it's going to be stored in here crypted until I decrypt it so this is decrypting it right there I'm just toggling that value and then of course if I go to edit it I can have it decrypted as well okay so it is stored encrypted and so what that will allow us to do is well a couple things number one we could abstract this to an environment variable now I'm going to leave it in just as a standard variable but since you now know how to create environment variables that would be a good place to potentially put it in your environment is actually using that database URL SSM peram and it's called SSM that's just the default name for it for the AWS systems manager that's the name of it as we'll see when we actually start using the package itself inside of our application so the main thing here is then I want to actually decrypt this data I want to be able to look it up and grab it so before I can look it up and grab it I want to grab the database URL out of the environment variables and so inside of myv I can leave it there but inside of the Ser list yaml I'll go ahead and just add it into exclude just so it never goes in and so at this point I wouldn't have access to my database client at all and that's what we want to change so to change it we're going to be using the AWS um client for JavaScript which is the AWS SDK and so we want to install this I'll go ahead and copy the install call here and then we'll just go ahead and install it onto our project it's really important that we do have it in our project as a dependency because it is an actual dependency for our runtime so the way it works is inside of index.js we can bring this in and I'll do const AWS equals to require and this is going to be the AWS SDK no surprise there then we initialize a SSM connection so there's going to be SSM equals to AWS SSM and then the region itself so region we will pass in here as well and once again I'll go ahead and add another con in here as AWS region and we'll go ahead and use Us East to once again you can have this as an environment variable that you might want to change when you need to the region and the parameter work in tandem together okay so now this is going to get all of the parameters or at least allow for me to get all of the available parameters inside of that particular region right so the parameter store in that region it'll show all of them that are in here this is a going to allow me to do that so the next thing is our actual database URL so now I'm going to go ahead and say const DB URL equals to well what exactly well to do this I'm going to go ahead and bring in the data itself the data from the pram store so let's just call it pram store data and this is going to be await SSM the initialized class right here and we also want this to say new because we are creating a new instance of that class so await SSM doget parameter and we want to pass in some arguments here the first argument is going to be the name this is the name right here the second argument will be with decryption and we want to say true we stored it as a secure string if it just says string we would not need to use with Des decryption it would just work then if I do promise I can turn this into an asynchronous call which is exactly what I want after I've got that I can actually use this neon Connection in here with the parameter store data Dot and this is going to be do parameter. value just like that and so this should actually now allow for us to make this work um and so obviously we need to make sure that this is actually working at least locally before we even push it into production because there is something else we'll have to change with our production environment so let's go ahead and do mpm runev and once again we see that debug is in here now that database URL is not in here and I'm not even using it anyway so there's nowhere in my application that has that database URL for the client itself so what I want to do then is open up the local host and let's just take a look let's make sure that I can still connect and still get that data and sure enough I am it's still giving me the exact data that we were expecting from the database itself in other words this parameter store data is actually working so we can console log this out and see that parameter store data as well uh just like this and let's go ahead and just refresh our application and reload the page and we refresh in there there it comes through and there is that data coming directly from the parameter store great so this same package could be used to set the parameter as well that that might be something we do later uh but for now we have the ability to use a production ready parameter for any given stage so naturally we could also come in here and do our constant and say stage and this is going to be equal to process. env. Stage or just simply prod right and so then we would come in here and just change this to being something along those lines and it should actually be right here and that will give us at least the ability to modify the stage once again this could be just its own environment variable itself so now that we've got this what I need to do is I need to prepare this whole thing for production to be able to just use this so one of the things about AWS Services is they can communicate with other services without a secret key or an access key they can just do it together and so in our local environment we have those keys in EnV now the only reason I can actually communicate to SSM with these environment variables has to do with what we did in the last part which was in the Imam so if we go into the I am and into our user groups into our particular policy that we've got on here we can see something important to understand why this user can actually access that data it has to do with this right here SSM and star now generally speaking you probably don't want to give every resource every access to this parameter store I did this as a quick and easy way to have access locally yes it would be something I would want you to change as well but I knew I was going to point it out so here it is I'm pointing it out and this is where we'd want to change it right here now so that any different project just doesn't have access to all of your parameters on your entire application but the thing is when we deploy this to Lambda it doesn't have permission it won't necessarily have default permission in here just like this so we need to actually add in the permission that it needs we need to give it the permission now one of the ways to do that is by inside of ser. yaml what we could do is inside of this provider here we can add in additional permission and the way we do that is by creating Imam and then we're going to create a new role this role will give it a specific name that starts with serverless I'll show you why in a moment as well and I'll give this serverless SSM roll and then the statements we need for this is effect and we want to allow resource and we're going to go ahead and say all and then I'll go ahead and write out all of the things all the actions I want to allow and so I'll just copy and paste them and we'll talk about them right now and where you can diagnose these things SSM get parameter what do you know we just did get parameter get parameters well that would be a multiple parameters by path and so on right so these aren't all of the permissions that we necessarily need need but it is all also opening up the resource everywhere so this role will play the same exact role as this effect right here and so if we wanted to get more specific with that we can go into edit here into our policy or any policy this is how we can start learning about those various permissions like we've talked about before we've got SSM here which is this systems manager if I get rid of this all let's get rid of that all call right there and just search for systems manager oops get rid of that comma and then look for systems manager as far as the service is concerned we can start seeing all of the various commands that we can use in here and this of course is going to correspond to the SDK itself how the SDK can be used so each one of these policies is important so get Pam we see that there what if we do create and we've got a bunch of different create in here right create resource right well we also might want put Pam right there that would be adding in one right uh and then maybe delete and so all of these different parameters that you might want to have for a resource is well this is where you'd find them this is the easiest way to find them in my opinion now of course we could just do all of them here but our Lambda roll certainly does not need all of that data the actual serverless role is mostly just for our user so going back to these serverless permissions I'm going to go ahead and abort all the saves and changes these permissions right here have nothing to do with our Lambda project itself right that's what this role does the only way it has something to do with that Lambda project is so that my local environment or really this particular user right here has access to do what it needs to do so these Keys these access keys and secret keys are not on the AWS Lambda by default which means that this code would not be able to work unless of course I were to add that actual roll on here and the reason we have this serverless Dash roll on here is so that we can can actually manage this so inside of our Json data inside of our policy here if we scroll down a bit and look for our role let's do a quick command and we look down a little bit for I am and we will be able to see that we've got some roles here so create roll put roll and so on notice the name of it right so we've got serverless Dash is how it starts which is exactly why I call this serverless Dash and then the SSM Ro right or I could actually say to be even more safe I could say my SSM rooll or project SSM Ro if if it does conflict with anything else that the serverless framework gives us but the idea is if I went in here and called it my SSM rooll like that I would have to update this policy for this particular user to adjust for that like it wouldn't be able to create it this is only able to create if the actual name of it starts with serverless great so now that we've got this let's go ahead and try and deploy this here so we'll go ahead and do mpm run deploy and what we should see is two environment variables working that's great I don't have any errors so far about the role itself uh but the main thing that we want to verify is the fact that the application once it's all said done is going to go based off of this database parameter that will end up coming through so I'll let this finish and then we'll check that out and so now I get this error of I am tag roll action I I don't have the ability to tag this role so it's not performed the tag roll so this actually gives us the opportunity to see how we can adjust our policy to make that work so back into our seress framework permissions policy we're going to go ahead and edit it I'm going to navigate down all the way to theam stuff and so what we've got here is get roll create roll and so on so in here I'll select it we'll do the included service and we we'll go ahead and look for the put and I think it was what put or no tag roll so we'll go ahead and do tag roll and there is the tag roll and untag roll so I now add both of those just so I have the ability to do that tagging and so we'll once again save this so we hit next here and save changes and then of course now I'll go ahead and run that deploy once again and of course that's how it goes this is how I was able to build out that policy in general and these things modify every once in a while there's little things that the serverless framework adds on that it needs access to do like taging a roll I don't think is so critical that it needs to have it happen but there's also things behind the scenes that I don't know that's going on that might have a good reason to be able to tag that role or have that particular permission um so yeah I'll let this finish and then we'll come back and here we go we got this success that it was able to deploy so I'll go ahead and grab the URL itself we'll just do a quick curl call it might take a moment for it to boot up completely all across the board but once it does it actually gives us the results that we were expecting so now what I want to do is simulate the problem with something on Lambda itself like if there was some issue on Lambda let me just go ahead and use you I'm just getting rid of the L there altogether right and the only reason for that is just to see what's going to happen with these results here and I also want to bring in something else and that is I'm going to grab this right here here I'm going to just go ahead and say now and then I want to go ahead and declare a Delta and this is going to be equal to dates. now minus now. now. time and then we're going to divide this by a th000 I want to see how long it takes for the application which is what this will do to actually reach the database and come back and that's what's going to happen with this new Delta here just so I can see what exactly is happened happening within the database so we can once we actually get everything working we will see a Delta so it'll be something that changed at least a little bit and so uh this is going to be our now. now or maybe our um you know DB now result let's just make it a little bit more of aose so it's not too confusing here and there we go okay so now that we've got this let's go ahead and do another deploy so I don't need to push it or anything like that I just run npm run deploy and it will start that process so what's going to happen is it's going to fail right so it's not going to find the parameter and it's going to be a major system error so what we're going to need to do is look for AWS Lambda we'll actually go into Lambda itself we don't need to type out AWS actually uh so we'll go into Lambda itself we'll click on here and we will see very soon where we will be able to navigate the problem with this and it comes into monitor this tab right here we can go to view cloudwatch logs and this will allow us to see some of the errors that might come through for this particular project from these log streams and we can see other logs as well like the things actually working but the idea is this log stream is how you might be able to diagnose errors with your particular project so in my case that that error is going to be this parameter is invalid and so the application itself won't attempt to use that parameter until it attempts to use the database client at least at this point right so realistically I think when I wanted to boot up the application I might then want to initialize the database client right away instead of always in the endpoint itself but those are optimizations that I don't really need to worry about because they're not really that necessary at this point but the idea being that we've got an error coming through and I just want to see if it's done and here we go we've got it done I'll go ahead and do a curl here um and we should get an error back invalid or internal server error so let's go back into our production and we've got two new streams here I'll go to the newest one click on that and we're going to see that we've got a runtime error right here and then we'll go parameter not found right so that's the actual error itself and this obviously means that a parameter name was not found I don't see anything else in here for catching the error or handling the error as in right here we might want to handle that error or down here we might want to handle that error in the actual application itself U but I wanted to simulate what would happen if there were an error with the parameters themselves so we could actually update and make sure that it's working correctly on our next deploy right and so this would be something you'd also want to test locally and make sure that all of that stuff's working uh but it is important to be able to also see the logs when you need to inside of a Lambda function and just a quick recap as to how to get there you go to the Lambda function you go to Monitor and you go to view cloudwatch logs and then You' be able to see all of the various logs in there including the metrics that are happening for the application itself and how quickly all of that's working and so once this actually finishes I do want to see that updated Delta I want to see what that value is because it's pretty impressive so while that's still building I'm going to go ahead and create a new uh we'll do mpm run Dev and then I'll go ahead and go back up I want to compare and contrast the production version versus the local one so if I do curl HTP Local Host 3000 I should get that Delta and it gives me a pretty fast Delta right this is local and then if I go into production do the same thing and it will take a moment to boot so the first one might be a little bit longer but then it's going to be just as fast or a lot faster uh it really depends on where you are located in the world and how quickly the Delta ends up working as well uh but overall that's it we are able to now check is how fast we can actually get the database call back to us a return call back to us have the database spun up and then also have our application now live and you know out there so we can we can use it in many different ways uh which is great so from here on out we just need to build on top of this because realistically we have the foundation we would need to build full-fledged applications we've got our database we've got a way to deploy it and we've got a way to secure it with the secur data itself um it's fantastic now one of the things that we're not going to cover are custom domain names so adding a custom domain name to this system it's not negatively supported by serus because there's a lot of different ways to put custom domain names on AWS Lambda there are some support out there for custom domain names but that's just not something we're going to cover at this time that would be the only thing I would want to improve about this project for fully production consumer facing projects if it's not consumer facing projects which is kind of what we're assuming this could go anywhere now we could actually use it anywhere just by using that endpoint itself and then making updates as we see fit now we're going to go ahead and decouple our application so it's a little bit more concise on how it works and it's just cleaned up then we're also going to update our AWS SDK we want to upgrade it to a newer version now this older version is still valid and it still works and it'll probably work for years to come but overall we want to start adopting the newer stuff because the package itself is probably smaller as well and maybe just a little bit easier to use than what we've got here with this promise and all that that's kind of a mess so let's go ahead and use the new package which is aws-sdk client SSM so we'll go ahead and install this into our package since we're installing that I'll go ahead and do mpm uninstall the AWS SDK I want to get rid of that one right away just to make sure I don't have that any longer so with this in mind I want to just change how I'm going to grab that parameter itself so to do this I'm going to go ahead and create a new module with lib secrets. Js and I'm gonna quite literally copy everything from this DB client stuff up and so this is where we'll change everything so I'm G to get rid of all of the expressjs things that we just simply don't need in here and this will be just be get database URL now and it's going to be roughly the same values here I do not need the neon stuff just yet we will decouple that one as well um but overall if I were to keep the old version this is how I would decouple it right just like that and then I would update where I need to use this database URL with the Imports as we'll see in a little bit as well okay so with these things in mind I want to go ahead and use that new SDK so what we can do is we can look in the documentation and scroll down a bit you can see the installation process we've already done that you can also see the import process is basically this right here so I'm going to go ahead and copy this and we'll go ahead and paste this up here now and so I'm going to get rid of this AWS here and to create the client we'll go ahead and come down here and say const client equals to well let's see how they do it in the documentation it says new and SSM client hey what do you know is very similar to what we saw before in fact we can pass the region in like we saw before as well the exact same way so that modification was already really simple so we can get rid of that and it's not a whole lot different going throughout so next one is going to be the actual pram data so I'll leave that in but I'll get rid of this git SSM parameter way but rather just turn this into an object itself then we need to actually create this as a command so we say con command and this is going to be equal to well what we've see in the documentation is this list associations command which is not what we want we want something different and there are a lot of different commands that you can run in here if you scroll down you will see all of them the one we need is of course the git param command so G parameters is in here so let's go ahead and grab that and I'll just search by it unfortunately it doesn't give me the actual command that I want by searching in here if you go into the API reference you will see it but what I know is I can just go ahead and change this to just get parameter command it's really just that simple so the command itself will then be new of that command with these arguments in here and then we want to grab the result from it with a wait and this is going to be client. send and that command and then the final data is just simply that results parameter. value and that's it just a SM a small modification to how this ends up working and then we'll go ahead and do module. exorts and the git database URL is equal to that right there great so what we could do now of course is change our DB client to work off these secrets now I could do it in the index.js or I can follow along this pattern of decoupling and decouple the DB client to its own location so that's what I'll do I'll do DB clients I'll use the S in here for a reason as you'll see once we get to the drizzle stuff now I'll go ahead and copy all this once again just because it's already working mostly okay and I'll get rid of the things I don't need which is serverless HTTP and express I also won't need this AWS part here instead what I'll do is WR under the neon import I'll go ahead and do con Secrets equals to require and then my new libr library for secrets and that's the one I'll use so I'll go ahead and get rid of all of the SSM stuff in here now and so really this pram data store is no longer going to be that instead we'll get rid of all these comments even I'll just do con DB URL equals to secrets. database URL and of course this is an asynchronous function so we go ahead and do await those secrets and now I can actually just use that database URL just like that so it's cleaned up a lot in both places if you ask me the database URL SSM pram I might put in here or maybe I have it in as an argument itself if I needed to change it and support other things uh but overall it's definitely cleaned up a bit so last thing of course is just to bring in our database client into the index itself so to do that we'll do module exports and the database client is going to be that database client let's go ahead and stick with that same naming convention we just did with the git database URL to get DB client and just change it ever so slightly and now in index.js here all we need to do is bring that one in as well this time I'll just go ahead and import the function itself and so we'll do const getdb client and this is going to be require and then do/ DB and clients just like that and of course the index file itself is not inside of Any Given folder which is why we can just do that so now that we've got that here is the old DB client which I'll go ahead and get rid of and now SQL itself can be just a wait get DB client right there and I can get rid of all of the old AWS client stuff as well as Neon right inside of this index.js because now it's imported in places that it makes a lot more sense so of course the last thing to test here is that this is actually working so let's go ahead and do mpm run Dev here and so there is my Dev server running and let's just do a quick curl call and we'll go ahead and do curl and after a moment or two because everything needs to spin up it go it does that exact call great so there's one last thing that I want to fix and that is this Delta here this Delta I don't think is actually accurate so what we want here is we want to grab now which is going to be date now we want to actually call this before we call our SQL command this will now be in the past where this should be in the present hopefully we're going to go ahead and change the ordering of this just slightly and I'll go ahead and get rid of the divided by a th000 here we'll save that and I want to just refresh real quick and run this and just see how quickly I can grab this data okay so let's take a look at the Delta now it should be a different number so this is still in milliseconds so we can put that back of SL a000 just to make it a little bit more accurate as to seconds uh but overall we just wanted to see something a little bit closer to how long it actually takes so I'm making this request from the other side of the world and it actually is still going pretty fast which is pretty nice um but with this in mind we're going to go ahead and do mpm run deploy I did say the other side of the world I meant the other side of the country um that's all so I'm going to go ahead and deploy it let that run there's one more thing that I might want to have in my scripts in here which is just going to be simply info so every once a while when you run deploy it's not necessarily going to always show the endpoint that you are using so using just info will give us that endpoint so we can see that by running it in here with mpm run info this will give us that data from the current one that's being deployed which is going to be this endpoint right and so the endpoint will or could change if you took it down and then brought it back up that endpoint will might most likely be different uh but I'm going to let this finish and then we'll just verify everything is working with our stuff decoupled and all that looks like it finished it was pretty fast this time so we'll go ahead and curl it out and I'll run that and there we go so the Delta is really really small right that's the point of what we see there and so the actual commands themselves the time stamp it's a little bit tricky to get an accurate representation of the time stamp that's happening but over overall we do see that the actual Delta is not really that different it's like almost instantaneous because of how close it is whereas when I was when it was on my machine it was a little bit longer and that would make sense because of how far away it is uh but it is very fast cool so now that we've got this decoupled and we're using the new AWS client it's time to actually start building out our schemas so we can actually get to the process of actually putting stuff in to our database now we're going to go ahead and implement the drizzle omm now OMS are great because they allow us to basically use our runtime language to manage our database in this case our runtime language is Javascript and it's going to be managing our postgress database and drizzle omm is going to handle that interaction for us so we can just write a bunch of JavaScript instead of writing a bunch of SQL and what it's going to do is it's going to allow us to insert data like you would with SQL it's going to allow us to retrieve data delete data anything you would need to query it but it also treats the data with the the same data type in other words if in the database it's an integer javascript's also going to treat it as an integer this is also true with time stamps and we've already seen that so using just the neon database client we actually saw this select now doesn't come back as a string it comes back as a date object itself which is how we're just able to do this in other words I don't have to parse it I don't have to like parse the date from here and build out some complicated parsers just to use the value from the database itself and that's the key here is we want to make it so it's super easy to use values directly from the database without making any major changes so let's go ahead and create our first schema so inside of DB here we'll go ahead and do schema. JS or let's call it schemas actually so schema. JS is where we'll Define our tables so this is what what we're going to do is we're going to do const lead table and for now I'm going to go ahead and just put a dictionary here and really think out what I want in a lead table table well I'm going to go ahead and say I want an email uh perhaps I want to have a timestamp right like a created timestamp and maybe I want a description maybe a source right maybe the first name maybe last name right and so these are all of the columns that I might want to store in my database now to keep things simple I'm just going to go ahead and just do email and timestamp for now but instead of calling it timestamp I'll just call it created at so the these are going to be the fields we will want to use and so we need to actually design these in a way that makes sense within the drizzle way of doing things so let's go ahead and comment it out for a moment and let's take a look at the drizzle documentation and how this is done so inside of drizzles you know om. drizzle. team in the docs if you scroll down here we've got these column types here for managing the schema this is where I like to start because well I want this to manage my database so we need to start with designing the tables we're going to design and of course you could reverse engineer this too if there were already existing tables but that's outside the scope of what I want to accomplish instead we want to just create the ones that we want to create so in here we're going to go ahead and look for a column type called email and we're going to be severely disappointed there is no column type email now this is for good reason that's because email is really just a string of data right it's just like abc abc.com that's just data that's just a string of data so validating that it's email is going to be something we'll do later for now we just need to treat it as if it was data and that is going to be text right so it's really just text itself so we're going to go ahead and follow this line of thinking right now to build out our lead table so I'll go ahead and copy and paste it in and we can't do it in this fashion instead we have to change it to const and then equals to require and that's how we actually do our Imports with this es5 or the Comm common.js module um and so the next thing is going to be our table so the the const table the actual variable name itself or the constant name in this case we actually want to keep it in as lead table the actual database table itself I'm going to call it leads so this is going to be my JavaScript name for the table this is going to be the actual database name for the table and what do you know this is also the same so the first thing is going to be our email we want to leave it in as email this is going to be the text data type or the text column and inside of there we're going to go ahead and leave the database as email as well so they are corresponded they're the same you don't always have to do that but that's one way to do it next we're going to go ahead and do our created at now within JavaScript I typically use this camel case and I think that's the best practice within JavaScript but in the database I might want to change it a little bit differently and use use snake case which is common inside of databases but you could use camel cases if you want as well so what I got here is a leads table but hopefully you have a little bit of a red flag going off or a little bell going off is like should I treat something like created as or created at as text well no there's another data type and we've already seen it we've already used it which is related to a timestamp itself so going back into our column types we can scroll down and we can see there's one called timestamp there's one called time there's one called date so I can actually use a timestamp itself and that's what I want so I'll go ahead and come in into my schemas and use a timestamp in here and so I'll go ahead and use that instead so we can also set a default here as to default now so default now works on timestamps it doesn't work everywhere else so if you wanted to set a default let's say for instance for a description let's do that now we'll just add in that new column I can add in a default here with just simply default and say this is my comment or something like that right we can really build that out on how we want to do it based off of the data T tables that we have here and so another advantage of using specific integer types has to do with doing calculations or running functions inside of the database itself so if I were to jump back into the neon console here I want to show you this in action so first off this select here I can run this and this will give me a bunch of numbers right it's going to generate series it's going to generate numbers from well in theory 0 to 100 but it actually goes into 11 101 rows so it does from 0 to 100 into however many rows that takes which is what that generate series does and now we can also count how many rows there are by selecting and running that and this is a database function to count up all those rows we can also use a database function to sum up all of those rows there's many different functions that you can do and you can also see how this would affect maybe different rows in there as well so if you did a 100 and you multiply each row by 1.2 that would give us that sum whatever that ends up being right and of course you can also do much bigger rows as well so this is where databases start to really outshine doing something directly in JavaScript you would actually do the calculation something this big you would do it on the actual database side and then you would bring it into JavaScript and so that's where these data types have get another reason to use them as the correct data type right so in the case of the time stamp this is great because then I could use the JavaScript stuff to calculate how long it's been basically when I want to display it but also if I wanted to do like the number um you know of entries I could do something like that and then that way I could then grab maybe an in a integer type so we come up here we've got an integer I could bring in an integer in here as to what that would end up being right and we could have this default being zero now the integer itself we would also want to import it okay so there's a lot of different ways on how we can think about writing out these actual tables themselves I'm actually not going to do that number of entries this way because there's a way to count it in the database as well with the email being the same uh so that's outside the scope of this one but these are generally the fields that I want to have but there is one more field I want to keep as well and that's going to be an ID field so every time I do an entry I want to have a new ID field in here and the way we do that is by using something called serial and we can set this as our primary key just like this and this will be our primary key for the database which helps with indexing and speed and all sorts of stuff but overall the primary key here and we'll go ahead and say not null in fact wherever I don't want this to be empty in the database I will go ahead and say not null the description itself it could be empty that's okay and so now I've got my actual schema that I want to use for my entire project itself I've got something a table with ID email description and so on so it's time to actually bring this in to our table or our database itself but the thing is I don't have a way to bring it in just yet so let's go ah and do module. exorts and Lead table and so what we've got here now is the starting of creating an actual table in the database but we don't actually have the SQL behind it so we need to create the SQL behind it and then we need to run or migrate that SQL and actually execute that SQL and so that's what we'll do in the next few now we're going to convert this JavaScript schema into an actual SQL migration file so to do this I want to start off with creating a folder called migrations now I'm putting it inside of the SRC because I really just want this all bundled in one place sometimes it's recommended that you just put it in your main project itself so with it in here with this folder existing and my schemas existing I'm going to go ahead and create a new file called drizzle. config.js so this configuration itself is going to be fairly straightforward we declare a constant called config and we set this equal to well our schema the location as to where it is and then where we want to Output this schema as in that migrations folder and then we're going to go ahead and Export this as a default so export default and the config itself so the reason I can do this is because the way I'm going to actually use this file is going to be right inside of package.json I'm going to go ahead and come below here and do something called generate and this is where we'll use use drizzle kit itself so drizzle kit will allow me to do drizzle kit generate colon PG as in postres and then config equals to drizzle. config.js or that file name and that file path so in this case the file path for drizzle. config.js is right next to package.json if you had it into the SRC folder you would do something like that okay so with this in mind I now have a way to call this file but I don't have the configuration correct so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this relative path here bring it in and what do you know then I'm going to go ahead and copy the relative path to migrations also bring it in and there we go so we can use slash if we need to uh but the idea being that it's a relative path to wherever drizzle config is and once again if it was in SRC we would get rid of SRC no surprise there okay so with this let's go ahead and run this mpm run generate and hit enter and all this is going to do is create our SQL file this is quite literally the SQL that will run to match this schema right here and if we were to change anything let's say for instance we got rid of this description here I want to generate that migration file and once again it shows me exactly what I need to run in order for me to match my schema to my database right so it's going to do each one of these things and that's it that's really just that simple and if I were to add a whole another table let's go ahead and add in a whole another table I'll call this lead table 2 and leads to whatever right let's go ahead and Export it just make sure you export it as well and then I run the schemas again now it's going to go ahead and show me hey what do you know it's creating a new table in here so since I haven't actually touched the database yet I can actually feel comfortable about deleting this folder if I try to run it again it's going to probably give me an error or it's going to actually do the entire thing itself right so the actual migrations folder was created this time uh but I've had it where it didn't create but what we see is it actually will now just combine those two commands into one and so this is where you can really learn a lot about SQL itself because well we're using JavaScript to generate that SQL so in my case I want to get rid of all that and I really just want that one single uh migration file itself and that's where we're going to leave it is just like that now there's one other thing to note is this meta folder in here is giving a snapshot of each change that's happening so it's really keeping track of the changes between these SQL files themselves so when we go ahead and run it that's how it knows not to do anything it didn't actually change anything because we didn't change anything in our migrations so that's actually pretty nice that it has a history of these changes the other thing about this that's really great is I can check this into G so I can keep those changes throughout and I can see all of the schem of changes that might happen so if at any time I need to roll back those changes I could and also I could run these migrations on well maybe a branched version of the database and make sure everything's working correctly before I actually run those migrations on the main version of the database which is yet another thing to think about when it comes to developing with the various schemas and of course drizzle om so at this point now that we can create or generate our migrations we actually need to perform those migrations and to do that I'm going to make my own CLI tool to actually make that happen just because it automates it just a little bit to work with our serous environment that we have and more specifically with our neon database and all of our neon client related things itself because as it stands right here this actually won't do the migrations for us we need to do a slight variation on this so let's go aead and and take a look at how to do that now now there's a few ways to perform these migrations one of them is you could just copy and paste it and just run it wherever you run SQL like for example in index.js we could run it like this we could go into the console run it there but those things aren't scalable and they're prone to a lot of Errors instead we want to automate them so to automate them I'm going to create a new SRC file called CLI SL migrator JS so this right here is is going to use TSX to be called so TSX SRC CLI migrator JS so we want to call it this way and the way it's called is by doing if require domain equals to the module itself we're going to go ahead and console log run this exclamation mark so obviously we need to fill out all of these things but before I do I want to make sure that TSX is even working so inside of my my package.json I want to go ahead and add in my Dev dependencies two things so mpm install D- saav dev. EnV and then also TSX so EnV is going to play an important role as well as we'll see in just a moment but in my migrator here let's go ahead and just run this I'll go ahead and use this command itself into package.json and we're just going to call this migrate there we go so MP M run migrate hit enter and run this great so that's exactly what we wanted to see the next thing I want to check is the environment variables access key and secret access key we just need one of them really so in my migrator here I'll go ahead and do console log and process. env. AWS access key write it again ooh undefined now this is why we use the EnV so if I just run require and. EnV then config run that and run it again now we can see that environment variable and it's coming directly from EnV so just like with our serverless package we have EnV being able to be used our now CLI package can also load in those environment variables like that now why is this important well hopefully you realize it's important because well we need to grab our secret we need to get that database your L and so back into my migrator here let's go ahead and import that database URL by doing cons secrets and this is going to be equal to require and dot dot slash and this going to be lib secrets and then now I'll go ahead and do my secret itself so how am I going to go ahead and call this secret because it's asynchronous well I'm going to go ahead and do async function and we're going to call this perform migration and then I'll go ahead and do the const DB URL equals to A wait secrets. git database URL and then I'll just console log that DB URL okay so then in this main module here I can just do the promise handling and we'll say Val equals to and something like this and then catch error and let's go ahead and console log the error okay and so we can exit the process with process. Exit 0 this is successful we can also do process. one as in unsuccessful okay so um there we go now I want to just see this database URL let's go ahead and run it again and our database URL shows up so this at the very minimum is how I can actually use those environment variables now we might need to change them we might need to use different ones but it's just important to realize that if I did actually use my environment variables let's go ahead and change it just slightly and do export the access key to something like ABC now it's in the environment I'm going to go ahead and comment out to this EnV here and I'll go ahead and run this again and now it just shows me ABC and I get an error right so that is why we actually use this required. EMV but it is actually not required as long as the environment variables are actually in the environment it will use them uh but if if are not in the environment which in our case they will not be we will go ahead and add in that that way can we can actually get the correct data itself which of course caused this error still so let's go ahead and just refresh that terminal itself and create a new one and then npm run migrate like that and there we go so now we've got that data Okay cool so now we need to build out and use that database URL and to do this we need to use a neon pool or a postgres pool uh but the neon seris pool now the idea for this is to have multiple levels of a transaction that might need to happen which is exactly why we're doing the serous pool and so the repo itself for this package actually has some good documentation on how to do exactly what we need which is doing our pool with a websocket itself so this is what we're going to be doing I'm going to go ahead and copy all of this and we're going to bring it on into our code itself for this command line so the first thing is I need to uh you know take out the actual import statements and change them so they are es5 and we'll do require and like that and then same with this and here we go great so let's go ahead and tab this in a little bit so first and foremost the connection string well what do you know it's to this database URL it's no longer process EMV it's just to that database URL okay so we would have a console if there's an error with the pool itself that's something that well basically like we would want to just reconnect or try something new so the next parts of this are how we actually run the query itself and so the things that are important that we're really going to change is this right here right and so that's where we need to actually grab drizzle and change how we use drizzle itself so inside of here is where we're going to run our migration so at the top we're going to go ahead and first off do const and drizzle and this is going to be require and it's drizzle o SL neon serverless and then I'll go ahead and also we're going to go ahead and implement this down here so we'll do const and DB equals to a weight drizzle of this client and our schema so we need to also Define where our schema is going to be so let's go ahead and grab the entire module itself so right above secrets I'll go ahead and do schema and this is going to be our DB and schemas okay there's our schemas there next what we want to do is bring in migrate so I'll go ahead and do const migrate and this is equal to require and this is drizzle o rm/ poost scjs SL migrator okay so this is a manual way to call migrate and then the next part is going to just be await and calling migrate on the database itself and then using the migrations folder which in our case is in SRC migrations right right here so grabbing that relative path we'll put that in there just like that so that's it that's how we will actually run those migrations at the very end here we'll await pool. end just to close out that connection after all of that stuff is done so this is definitely in a lot of different places for the documentation uh but the key thing here is that we got our database and if of course if there's not a database so we'll go ahead and say if not DB URL then we'll just go ahead and return something along those lines uh but now we can actually go ahead and run this migration again and so let's go ahead and run it and at this time what it should do we should get rid of these console logs but overall what it should do is actually update our database and so we'll see that with I'll just console log in here like migrations done and we'll say running or run migrations get rid of this and then migrations error great okay so with this in mind let's go ahead ahead and run it again no big deal running migrations migrations done great so to verify let's go back into our neon console into our tables here and what we should see is our leads table inside of that leads table if we wanted to look at some of the data about it we see the different columns and their data types as we see here great fantastic so let's go ahead and take a look at our actual schemas themselves uh notice the ID is down here as well em created that let's go ahead and bring in the description and just do an endtoend example where we go ahead and run our generate and then we run our migrate okay and done refresh in here leads look at the description is right there great so now we have a way to change data in our schema change the design of our schema based off of different columns that we we might want to have then we have a way to actually migrate that schema now the client the pool itself can do a lot of different transactions at once which is why we use the pool itself and it does it using websockets so you're not going to do this in a serverless environment that's why we needed to create a command line interface for it you would not run these migrations once you deploy it to service you run it beforehand and so that's even more reason to actually get the production database URL as well or whatever one you're wanting to deploy to which could add in some additional arguments that you might want to have for that maybe you always have the the production database URL as a part of your secrets so in here maybe you would want to grab this and go get prod database URL and change this stage in here just to be simply prod now I'm not going to do that I'm going to leave it as is uh because that's really the only string that we are using as the production but you could also change the stage itself in the environment if you wanted to change it to something different getting that database URL assuming that it is available uh and if it's not it'll just go ahead and say you know it'll return it and not try to migrate anything so yeah uh the pool is great you can do a lot of Big Time queries with this pool if you were not deploying to serverless this is probably the method you'd want to use for your database in general for some of those bigger transactions that might take a little bit longer so cool now that we've got this we just need to start inserting data into our database using crud methods and then we're going to need to validate that data to make sure it's valid data uh but that's really the main things we're going to do as far as the actual uh you know schema and database related queries are concerned with our schema created our migrations done we are now ready to start actually creating and retrieving data from our database using drizzle and neon so to do this we're going to actually Implement a curl function so we use Curl HTTP col SL localhost 3000 and then leads that will be how we get that data which in this case it's not found currently then we'll go ahead and also use the same exact idea with grabbing post data so to do Post data with curl we do-x say post we're going to go ahead and pass in a header this particular header is going to be content type of application Json which is very common for data that's using an API of some kind and then we pass in data in this case I'm going to go ahead and put single quotes on the outside of it and then double quotes on the inside so we'll say something like email and test test.com and then we'll use our endpoint right there so those are the two endpoints we need to configure so the first step of this is to allow our actual data from the expressjs application to work so the first one is going to go into index.js we're going to go ahead and grab this git path here and we're going to go ahead and just say leads so leads this will allow us to get that data so if we were to run that curl command after we restart our server here we can actually see that data come through or in this case it's just saying hello world now the post data is not any different than this we're going to go ahead and grab this and just do post so instead of dogit it's just poost and that's it so with that in mind we can go ahead and curl it again actually we will go ahead and restart the server one time and then I'll go ahead and press up a few times to that curl post and once again it says hello from path and so both methods are now working HTTP post and HTP git typically speaking you use the post method to you know create data or update it sometimes you use a different method than update but we'll just leave it in as create data so that's what we want to do here and the way we actually can create data is first and foremost we're going to change the Callback Handler to asynchronous and then we're going to go ahead and say that we want to grab the actual data that's coming through from this request itself so that means we're going to go ahead and say the email data is going to be equal to await requestbody we'll just start with request. body or R eq. body so what we want to see here is just echoing back maybe the body data in here and we'll just go ahead and use it's something like that so once again we'll go ahead and restart our server here and then I'll go ahead and do another curl command run this and there's our body data coming back but it looks kind of weird it says buffer so the reason for this is because natively this data is not going to just automatically be turned into Json data so to change it into Json data and basically to accept this application Json content type header we just change change our Express app just a little bit by doing app.use and express. Json just like that so with this in place again restarting our server what we'll be able to do is we'll be able to run this call again and now it'll actually Echo back that data to us which means we can now start to actually bring this into our database which of course is going to require us to do that and so the actual body we can go ahead and now say that's the data and then we can go ahead and say the email is inside of that data itself and now I can just Echo back that email great so here is where we need to insert data to the database so how are we're going to go about doing this now first and foremost in the DB folder here I'm going to go ahead and create a file called crud DJs now what we're going to be focusing is the C and the r of crud that is creating data and retrieving data that's it we're not doing anything more than that at this point but once you have this found in place you'll be able to use it wherever you need to so the main thing here is we want to go ahead and create another asynchronous function so async function and this function itself we're going to just go ahead and call it add lead or maybe new lead new lead might be better and then in here we just want to bring in the email itself and then I'll go ahead and console log the email okay so that's that function then we'll go ahead and create another function and we'll call this list leads and once again we don't necessarily need an argument here and I won't console log anything at this point and then we'll go ahead and do our module exports and do new lead equals to new [Music] lead and then module do exports and list leads equals to list leads now no surprise here to actually use this data back into our expressjs app we can go ahead and grab it so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say const and we'll just call it crud and this is equal to require and this is going to be DB and crud okay so the reason for that is then in my leads here I'll be able to grab my data so let's go ahead and just say that our results are equal to a wait cr. list leads and then our results down here for the data itself which will be a single result this is going to be uh new lead and then we would pass in this data right here now my git command I need to change this to be an asynchronous callback as well and so that's the goal that we're working towards here basically just have a quick and easy way to add a new lead in and all that so of course this shouldn't be anything new nothing about this so far is really that challenging to do at this point hopefully if it is challenging then yeah this might be a little bit too advanced for you but overall what we want to do now is we want to use this schema to do those two things getting new leads in our database and listing things out now of course the first thing I actually need to do is add data in there before I can list any of that data out so how do we do this well if we jump into our client we have a database client but we don't have anything related to drizzle drizzle has its own database clients itself so if we actually go into access your data in query what we see here is this drizzle Command right here where it takes in a client and then it also can take in a schema so what we need is just the drizzle portion of this and basically we want to have a drizzle client itself so now what I'm going to do is change a new client function inside of my clients for my database and this is now going to be git drizzle DB client just like that roughly speaking and then the SQL itself is going to go from the other normal git DB client cuz we definitely need to use that one and all I need to do is I'm going to go ahead and grab in drizzle and it's going to be equal to require and drizzle omm and what we want within drizzle omm is going to be related to the database itself in our case the database is neon so we'll do neon HTTP this is coming directly from their docs and so we'll go ahead and wrap this SQL client into drizzle itself and so now we'll go ahead and Export that get drizzle DB client in here just like that great so that's the first step back into crud here now we're going to go ahead and do con client equals to require and this is going to be ourclients or we'll go ahead and say clients in here and now I'll do con DB equals to await clients. G drizzle DB client great so this is the drizzle DB portion and so what we see in the documentation is we now are at this part so we're close to doing something like this and the documentation in drizzle documentation for the querying is vest there's a lot that you could do in here so we're really just scratching the surface of what you can do but the idea is something not too dissimilar to this once we actually get into listing out our leads but before we get there I actually want to insert new leads and the way I'm going to do that is by doing const and schemas equals to require and/ schemas and so now with that schema what I'll do is I want to go ahead and grab in a result and this is going to be equals to await dp. insert where we're going to insert it in is related to the schema and the lead table all right so we're inserting it into that specific schema this again is from the documentation so if you go into the documentation under under accessing your data you can see this insert here and we see that it says DB insert this users corresponds to what we've been calling lead table right I just made it this way so it's a little bit easier for me to understand what's going on and to unpack at any time but then we see thist values here and that's the key of actually inserting the data is values and then what data we want to insert so in our case our schema only has really one thing that we're wanting to insert in here and that's the email but if we had other fields in here this is where we would do it we would actually bring in those other fields so what I want to do here is then this is going to be an actual object we'll pass in here that object we will unpack and then go ahead and bring it in to the values as well so email being email in other words once we have this data Maybe we're going to go ahead and say new lead object and then you would pass that in something like that uh but for now I'll just leave it very verbose so it's going to be the actual email itself so what's happening here is it's going to insert that data but then it's just going to be done so if we actually wanted to return data we can do returning just like that so that will actually return back the result that's come through in here and we can narrow this down even more if we wanted to to let's say for instance the time stamp or uh let's go ahead and do that we'll just go ahead and bring back timestamp and this is going to be the data based off of the schema again and the data that's being inserted here so timestamp and then dot uh let's go ahead and grab what the schema value is in our case it's created at so there we go so this allows me to return back that timestamp as some sort of result so we'll go ahead and return back that result and see what ends up happening there okay so now it already is in place in that actual location so I'm just going to go ahead and console well let's go ahead and Echo back the results I think I have something close to that I'm going to go ahead and just do results and results so just changing it slightly we're not echoing back the data but rather echoing back what goes into the database so with this in mind we want to actually call that that one curl command that we were doing just a moment ago with the post and then I'll go ahead and run that and of course it might take a moment for it to fully boot up and I actually might have to restart my server alt together uh so let's go ahead and try that once again and we'll go ahead and email put that email in there we get an empty reply from server and so if we come back in here I get this n column value okay so part of the problem that I'm currently facing has to do with validation right so is this valid data the other problem is how I'm actually passing the data into my new lead I just talked about it I actually turned it into an object and then I unpacked that object right here so we actually want to just pass in the Raw data right here for now and then we'll go ahead and undo that so now the request body goes directly into the new lead but we still need that validation of some kind so while this is working with this we'll go ahead and just run it and see if we get anything back from the server in this case I do get something back I get that time stamp back or at least what I've been calling a time stamp and notice that I get an actual array back and a list of items back so what's happening here is inside of this result it's inserting it into the database and then returning back a list of items so basically we will say then if the result. length is equal to let's say one then we're going to go ahead and return back the result zero right and then otherwise we'll go ahead and return back the whole list of results themselves or we could say null or just an empty list or something like that but the idea being that if this is a list then we'll just return back that first the index value in that list and so returning back a specific time step we can also return back so so uh new email or the actual inserted email and then just do something like this right and that will actually change back what we return as we can see we might have to restart the server but if I go ahead and try it again uh yeah let's go ahead and restart the server here and we'll go ahead and run this one more time and when we get back should be that email or new email basically as the object that's coming back to the you know expressjs application so great so we now have a way to insert data now in this case I actually don't want just one single thing I want all of the data the entire schema to come back to me and that's what's going to go into the front end but we could narrow that down if we were interested in doing that so now if I do it again let's go ahead and restart that server again and we'll go ahead and run this and what we get of course is all of the data including the ID in here so at this point it now seems that I have seven items in here based off of how many times I submitted it to the backend and notice that the ID is auto incrementing the created timestamp is changing as well the description has that default text that we had in here uh right there so the last thing that we would need to really do with this crud is to well build out this list leads so it's actually very similar to what we've got here except it's just using different database commands so when you think about listing things out you're not inserting in any data but you're going to be using the same schema so instead of inserting we're going to go ahead and use db. select and then instead of insert it will be just from and that's roughly all we need to do so I can go ahead and get rid of this values here this time we're just going to leave it as results and I'll get rid of this all together and so I'll go ahead and put that in there just like that okay very simple very straightforward and then we can also do something called limit we can call limit on here on the number that we want to send back and so now with this in mind we've got got our leads here there's our results I'll go ahead and give out results here as the results I probably don't need that message in there any longer on either one so let's go ahead and save that and this time I'm going to go ahead and just curl the one single leads so we'll just run curl which will be a get request by default I'm going to go ahead and restart that server and then I'll go ahead and run that curl command and what I should see is all of those leads coming back in the item of results right and then again if I were to submit some more I can curl it again and once again I'm getting more results so back into crud what we could do is a lot of different things to just make this a little bit more organized for example so I'm going to just add in one little quick element here and we're going to do uh const and this is going to be descending and we're going to say equals to require and this going to be drizzle or in okay so I'm going to just reorder this and then do just order by and this is a camel case here and what we want is the sending value of the schema data so we'll go ahead and grab this schema data here and then I'll grab the field I want it to be ordered by so in this case we have created at so descending value of created at and let's go ahead and restart that server again and then I'll go ahead and refresh this request and so what we should see is a reordering of it so ID of nine is coming first instead of three and so if we wanted to see this a little bit further we can also do like maybe get lead so git lead would be an individual item and maybe we're just going to grab it by the ID and so once again we're going to select that same table but now we can use a condition in here called where and within where we can actually import something from drizzle called EQ as an equal so we would say where EQ and this is going to be our leads table. ID is equal to the argument of ID and then we'll go ahead and Export this as well so get lead get lead get lead and these results should actually be a single result now similar to like what we saw with our new lead and once again I'll go ahead and grab this single result if it exists otherwise well go ahead and say null right so if it's not a single result then null now this should be a single result because of the ID itself and so back into our index what we could do is just try this out with Git lead and then some result that we are pretty sure is going to happen which is the ID of nine and so let's go ahead and restart our server and then we'll rerun our call our curl call and then this should give us that one single result back and sure enough it does right so this wear Clause is also very powerful because it can filter things down in this case it filtered it down to just one thing where it's equal to this and this if you're familiar with SQL this is a very SQL like command that's happening here and of course if we only wanted let's say for instance the ID in here we could do table. ID and put this in as ID and like that so this is selecting the ID from that value and then we can curl it again let's go ahead and restart that server again and run that one more time and so that would actually give us just that data and that would be true whether or not it's an individual item or a listing of items and so drizzle gives us this really powerful way to perform SQL without writing a bunch of SQL commands but they're SQL like so it's getting closer to what you would need to do to write the SQL commands yourself and so while you're learning drizzle you're also learning a lot about SQL without writing a bunch of of it and it's really just that straightforward so at this point I will challenge you to go into the documentation and just find how you can play around with this data more because there are so many different queries that you could write and then of course you would want to update data and delete data as well but with all three of these we have a foundation to how you might end up doing all of those things uh so I do encourage you to read more about the database itself but at this point it's actually pretty powerful where we're at we can definitely improve it but as far as an API is concerned to store data and more specifically email data this is it we can absolutely do it but we are leaving one critical piece out and that is of course this data validation so that's something we need to do now let's take a look at Zod now we're going to do some very basic validation using Zod now you can absolutely make this more robust by using drizzle Zod which actually corresponds really closely to our schemas that we've already built and then even more robust is now we're going to go ahead and use Z as a way to validate the data we have coming through now eventually you can make this now we're going to go ahead and validate our data that's coming through from our request so I'm actually going to change this data to post data in instead and then we'll go ahead and grab the data itself from somewhere else which will be a wait and we'll call it validators do let's say validate uh lead and then we'll pass in the post data there so naturally we need to bring these things in and actually make them happen so to do that we're going to go into our DB and we're going to create something called validators JS and then I'm going to go ahead and generate some sort of validation function so we'll go ahead and do async and we wanted to call call it the function of validate lead so I'll go ahead and do that function validate lead and it's going to take in post data and then it's going to return some stuff and we'll do our module exports and validate lead equals to validate lead so the things we want to return is for sure the data itself the actual validated data right that's a key part of this now I also want to see if there's an error so I'll go and say has error and then maybe a message now the reason for that is then I can change the respon response based off of those two values so in other words if the has error is true then we're going to go ahead and return one type of response and then if the otherwise we'll go ahead and say else if the has error is equal to undefined then we'll go ahead and do another response now if it's undefined I'll go ahead and just give a message of server error and has error the actual status code will be 500 and then if it does have an error in general we'll just go ahead and say 400 and I'll give it a message based off of the message that's going to come back or we'll go ahead and say something like invalid request please try again okay and then down here with the new lead itself assuming that that actually worked and we didn't have to do a tri Block in there uh we'll go ahead and change the result to being 2011 because that's typically what happens when you create data the status code will be 2011 so with this in place we need to build out this validate lead function so the first things is are how we're going to respond back and that's going to be has error true and then message just being an empty string so the way we're going to validate this is by using a package called Zod now Zod itself is very popular and it also has a lot of other features to it as well as Integrations to drizzle and then maybe even more robust validation messages with this Zod validation error but what we're doing is something very straightforward we're just validating the email we just want to make sure that that's working so when we do insert data into our database it's valid data and it's not invalid data so to do this I'm going to go ahead and import or actually install Zod so we'll do mpm install Zod and then inside of my validators here we'll do const and z and this is going to be equal to require and simply Zod so what I would normally do is I would probably put this schema the actual validator and the schema together i' put them right next to each other because they're based off of each other but in this case I'm just going to go ahead and put it in this validate lead function and so that means I'm going to go ahead and say my lead object validation something like that or just simply lead equals to Z doob and then we can start to design or format what we want to validate in here and so what it's going to what's going to happen is we can put any sort of data in here we we can put a name we can put an email we can put a description and then in here we can put those things that correspond so like name email description we can fill these out more but the idea is what you put in here might correspond directly to what's inside of the lead itself so in our case it's just going to be the email itself so instead of name and description we're just going to use email and the way we validate that is by having an actual dictionary an actual Z object in here and that means z. string so we definitely want it to be a string in here so it's not going to be a number that's for sure and then we can use email as well and so using email is another method that's available to us because of Zod so if we look in Zod and do a quick email search in here we can actually see some validation that's going on and there are a lot more places where we can actually call email and you can actually see that in the Baseline validations so we can also validate the size of it we can make it bigger or smaller right we can validate the length of it which is similar to that uh we can do what it starts with what it ends with if we wanted a certain domain name um there's a lot of different things on how we could go about doing the validation itself which is beyond the scope of what we're trying to do here I really just want some simple validation and so this is really designing the way we're going to validate it then when we actually want to validate it we will use lead. part so let's go ahead and say valid let's do valid data equals to lead. parse and now what we're parsing is we're actually going to pass in an object of some kind so this needs to be an object which in our case it is it's the request post body object itself and of course if this is incorrect it's going to run a validation error itself so I'm going to go ahead and run catch and error so we want to put it into this catch statement like that and basically what we would do then is say let has error right so we'll leave it as undefined and then I'll go ahead and say has error equals to false and then has error equals to True right so if it doesn't have an error then we will you know set it accordingly so the error is only going to come when we try to parse out this data so this valid data really is actually going to be let valid data and I'm going to set this equal to just an empty dictionary and basically that's what's happening here this parse call is going to parse out all of the data that I actually set inside of here so if the post data had a name for example it's only going to validate the things that I declare and it will only return the things that I declare so that now that I've got this valid data here I can actually pass it in and then we'll go ahead and just do let message and then I'll give it a message of equaling to an empty string here and then the message being invalid data invalid email please try again okay so now we've got our validations and our various validation errors so let's go ahead and try to run this now so mpm runev and then I'll go ahead and do a curl call in here just like we've seen I'll go ahead and run this I get an empty reply from the server so let's go ahead and see what's going on my validators is not defined so let's go back into this page here and we'll go ahead and valid or actually bring in our validators the entire module let's make sure we exported it and it looks like we did so let's go ahead and try that again we'll rerun the server and then I'll go ahead and trigger a call and I get invalid request please try again so that invalid request please try again is coming from this right here so the message doesn't seem to be coming back from this validate lead so let's go ahead and see why let me bring this back here so we got our message and message ah there there it is right here I need to go ahead and pass in that message so we'll save that and let's go ahead and refresh that server again and then we'll go ahead and come back in here run it again and now I get invalid email please try again so let's go ahead and do an actual valid email by just putting this at the at sign hit enter and now what we should see is of course the database is going to have to spin up and then we see this so the nice thing about this validation is it's actually not going to hit our database until it's actually valid data which is another reason to do this and of course this is sort of the basic level of doing this kind of validation the more robust and more advanced level would be using drizzle omm because you can build out schemas based off of other schemas and what I would actually do from here is to modify my schema of validation that I've been doing and do something along these lines where insert user schema and you could import that in this validate lead if you'd like or you could just just use the schema directly in the view as well but the reason I like doing this validate lead here is I can actually have a little bit more robust methods but of course there's nothing stopping you from actually putting in the post data itself uh so yeah that's how we can actually validate this data and we do it using Zod feel free to make this more powerful and also research a little bit more about Zod itself on how you can just do that much more validation to me the validation is as good as you can actually use it as as you can actually implement it right so I could definitely spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to give a much better message than invalid email as in the validator itself actually will give you better validation errors than just invalid email right so I can actually see what those messages would be directly from the validator itself so let me just show you real quick if I restart this and we do an invalid data again I run that again it says invalid email if I go back into the node I can see just exactly what different validation errors are going so yeah we can absolutely make the messages themselves much more robust than what we've got here but to me it's like we better just validate the data and then provide some sort of message that makes sense as well so another thing that you could consider doing in addition to validating the data is you could also check to see if it's already exists in your database right if it's already there and the way you would do that is very similar to like what we were talking about with crud where it's like listing out the leads but more specifically looking where the email matches the requested email and if that exists then we run another sort of validation error which is something that's outside the scope of this but we're working that direction the key of all of this with whenever it comes to inserting data from the Internet is you almost always want to clean that data and validate it before you want to send it into the database the database itself will help with the data types whereas the validator itself will help us with these kinds of messages and prevent as many database server errors that they could possibly be because of poorly formed data uh so yeah validators are great and fairly important so yeah hopefully you start using them now uh it's pretty simple and of course it can be a lot more robust thanks to zods and its powerful tooling so let's keep going now we're going to go ahead and automate the process of staging our application so like the dev stage for example when I make some changes with the code I want to be able to deploy it to GitHub and then GitHub automate the process of deploying the application on AWS Lambda but also branching our database at that point in time so we can work off of that and the way we're going to do this is by of course updating our secrets this is the key part we actually need to update our secrets for that stage so if you think about this in seress diagel we have our production environment going through and this database URL well we actually don't use that anymore so we're going to be gone altogether with that one so what we need instead is really the stage itself and so this is going to be based off of an environment variable that we will then later set but the default stage is going to be prod we're going to use the production stage as default now the reason for this of course is going into our secrets here where our database URL is actually stored that's where that stage is being set right so then in my get database URL I can actually modify what stage is going through so in other words in my Dev stage I can add in stage of Dev and get rid of this database URL right here and get rid of it basically anywhere so we don't accidentally expose it when we don't need to so of course our AWS access keys have the ability to get that database URL that's stored in this parameter of course one of the things that you're thinking about hopefully is the fact that we set this parameter manually so we actually went into AWS to set it manually that isn't automated it's quite literally the opposite so what we need to do is we need to automate the process of not just the stage itself but also setting in that database URL now luckily for us actually using the neon CTL it's really easy to Branch the database so if we look at the branches that are available uh we can see that with neon CTL branches and list we can see all the branches that are available and right now it's just the main branch so if we want to create a new one we could do it like this create name and then like Dev right so that gives us back this connection string here and of course if I wanted to use that connection string or just the connection string I can use neon CTL and connection string and then the branch itself of Dev and so that's going to be the exact same connection string as we see and so this one we want to treat as ephemeral we want to be able to delete it at any time and then Branch it later at any time both things we want to be true but that presents A new challenge with our production application and when I say production I mean one that's running on AWS Lambda regardless of the current stage itself so we need to be able to automate the process of updating our parameter store and luckily for us it's actually not a whole lot different than getting data so we'll go ahead and do that now and let's go ahead and put data we'll do put and parameter command and that's the command we're going to use now it's almost identical to this git database URL so I'll go ahead and paste that over and copy it and so the idea then is the param path needs to change based off an argument so we'll go ahead and do the put database URL and there's going to be a stage that we'll pass in here and I'll just call this cons Pam stage which is going to be equal to the stage that's coming through and otherwise it's going to just be simply Dev what I want to check right away is if the Pam stage is equal to the prod then I'll just go ahead and return I don't want to change the pro the production stage ever right I don't want to change this automatically that's something I'm happy to go in manually and change if I need to and so this pram stage is now going to be what the actual path is for this item or really the database URL name which of course comes down here so we go based off of that for am stage and now we'll be able to modify it in just a moment so this put URL database URL we actually need to have the DB URL value as well and so that's going to be part of the arguments we'll end up using everything else is pretty much the same of course if we wanted to change the region based off of our environment variables we could totally do that I'm going to leave it in as just the default one that we've been using uh so because I'm not really going to be changing anything else but the idea here is the other parameters that we want is the value so we use value here and we'll pass in that database value now once again if that value does not exist then we'll go ahead and return this element here and basically it's incorrect it's not going to work um so we still want to use this decryption but the way we do that is instead of with decryption we just declare the type itself and this is going to be secure string and of course we need to put that in the string itself so the idea of secure string is of course coming directly back into the console itself when we did create a new parameter here we have these three type options here I'm just using secure string and all of the other default options in there yes there are ways to modify this as well so feel free to look at the AWS SDK documentation for that next up the final thing is overwrite and I'm going to go ahead and say true so basically whenever I want to put a new stage database URL I want to overwrite the value that's currently in there just to make sure that that it is my latest value of course there could be issues and errors with this process which is why we don't do it with our production database we only do it with everything that's not production everything that's not the main stage that we're using so of course the final commands are basically the same but instead of get parameter command we'll use put parameter command in there and then I'll just return the result we'll save it just like that so before I go any further I can I will tell you now we can also do something called delete parameter command where we can actually delete and basically undo everything we just did and it's a little bit closer to this git URL where you just basically use the name itself but the reason I'm actually not going to be deleting the command itself is it makes it a little bit more complicated but also since we are going to be overwriting the database on a regular basis it doesn't really matter if that's the correct connection string or not so I'll go ahead and just leave it in as just put next up we'll go ahead and do module and and export. put database URL we'll go ahead and Export that out so we can start the process of automating it now the way we're going to automate it this is by using a command line tool we're going to make our own command line tool so we're going to copy this migrator one and I'll go ahead and just call this put secret. JS now this is actually more like put database secret so maybe you want to change the name of it uh but I'm not going to change the name now first off the migration command we don't need this function anymore we already have a function we just created that function on what we're going to end up doing and so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of all of the things related to my gr now the main reason I actually copied that is to remember I definitely do need the EnV configuration because remember in order for me to use the AWS SDK itself I need to have the environment variables for the AWS secret access key and the ID both of those things I need in there which is exactly why we've got this command line tool going and why I like copying these other command line tools I use the same sort of stuff um and so now the question of course is like what are we going to put in here so before I do that what I want to do is I want to declare args and there's going to be process. argv and then we'll go ahead and do slice of two now the reason I have slice of two is because the way this works is going to be the same as the migrator but of course instead of it being the migrator it's going to be put secrets and then we'll go ahead and do something like stage and then the DB URL so this is going to allow me to get everything after like basically these two items here and so all I want to do then is just check if the rs. length is equal to two then we're going to go ahead and do process. exit one that's it so we just want to exit it and say something like along the lines of console log and usage is that simple enough okay so now let's go ahead and try and run this one I'll copy the relative path here or basically run TSX so I'm gon to go aead and clear this out we'll do npx and then TSX run all of that I'll start out with hitting enter and it'll say run migrations so this is a problem this should be not equal to two let's try that again we run it again and now it's giving me the usage itself so we'll go ahead and try Dev and then sum DB your L hit enter and now it says run migrations which of course should be you know update secret right something like that there we go so how are we going to update the secret well we're going to grab the arguments themselves and the way we do that is by doing con stage and DB URL and it's going to be based off of those args so this is of course is unpacking it based off of the position it's in which means that if we accidentally do the incorrect position we've got some issues here here so this might be where you want to check if the stage is equal to like Dev or something along those lines and then go ahead and run everything else I'm not going to do that I'm just going to assume that we can have any stage we want in any database URL we want so we'll go ahead and set the actual Secrets now from our new Secrets function so to do this I'll go ahead and say const Secrets or Secrets equals to require and lib and then Secrets okay and we'll do secrets. put database URL what do you know we can put in our stage and our DB URL here so the idea here is it is an asynchronous function so you want to do a wait but the nice thing is with asynchronous functions is we can actually treat them as promises so we can just do then and we'll go ahead and say value and we'll do console log secret set and with that value whatever that might be so we go ahead and do value and then put these into back ticks and then process and exit being zero because it's successful and then we'll go ahead and do catch and in this case it's going to be error and once again we'll go ahead and run something similar to this but now secret not set and the error and we'll go ahead and exit at one okay cool so now that we've got this let's go ahead and set a secret I'll just go ahead and run this value here hit enter and we've got update secret secret set object. object so what is the object that's actually being logged in here so we'll go ahead and do console log value and then we'll go ahead and do Secret set and let's just call this updating uh you know database URL let's try that again again and we run that and here's the value that comes back now this is the default result from the actual put database URL that's what this is this is right here so we can actually see that the status code is 200 which is successful right of course we could also then get the result we could quite literally use something very similar to what we did with this git database we could quite literally go and grab the result itself to get the actual value but it's not necessary really we just need to know that the status code is 200 and I'll let you unpack that and handle those errors later um but overall we just want to verify that that secret is actually in our parameter store now so in this the correct region that I set it in I'm going to go in here and what do you know there it is and so I'll go ahead and scroll down here and debug the value or decrypt the value and we've got our sum DB URL here so it's definitely working it's actually putting that database in there and every time I run it it creates a brand new version of it so I can refresh in here and we you can see that version and that thing is actually changing so if I change it again and refresh in here we can see what that is so actually the nice thing about this is there is a way to get different versions of it as well so if for some reason in the future you want to be able to change this to different versions you could totally do that uh which is pretty cool so now we actually need to put the correct database in there right so again using the same idea we're going to now do our NE on CTL and this is going to be our Branch or rather connection string and then we want to get the branch of Dev okay so this is going to be that connection string the way I'm going to automate this is by putting it into a export command now if you're on Windows this right here is not going to work for you until you go into GitHub actions there's a way to do it this is just not it anyways so we're going to export this as our uh we'll go ahead and do this our database what's call this our stage DB URL and this is going to be grabbing it just like that okay so now I can use MPX right here Dev and then use dollar sign of that and oops not dollar sign equal dollar sign let's get rid of that dollar sign equal dollar sign and now we've got the updated database version six let's go and refresh in here and so now we should actually see that database URL and it's there so of course we just need to verify that that part is actually working and we can do that thanks to of course this process. env. stage and our EnV dev has that stage as well so let's go ahead and run our local mpm run Dev our local application version our offline version notice that's that stage is coming in there so one of the things we might also want to check maybe is on our homepage is putting that stage out there so let's go ahead and grab that argument like this and we'll go ahead and put this on our homepage just to make make sure that we actually are using the correct stage in that environment so let's go ahead and restart that run it again so I'll go ahead and open up local host and so what we've got is that stage of Dev so what we can see then is we can actually start adding in some data now of course inside of the neon console we can verify this as well so going into the tables we see that we have our main branch and our Dev Branch so let's go ahead and add a few leads in here and of course the way I'm going to do this is by using that curl command so let's go ahead and I'm going to copy and paste what we used in that last part uh but there we go I'm going to run this a few times and then I'll jump back into my neon console here and we should see all of those new leads and we do so if I go back and change the branch to main something like that and also see those new leads they are not there so it is now working on that branch which is great so of course the last few things that we would really need to do is to push this into production but one of the things that I also want to make sure that I'm doing when I actually run this is inside of package.json perhaps this is where I'm going to want to run that command just to remember it um but the thing is since I'm going to be automating it what I'm really going to be doing is using this inside of GitHub actions itself so this is going to be a GitHub actions CLI command that will run when we get there uh but overall this is fairly straightforward on how we can set the staged URL and set the branch so of course the last thing that we could really test here now is to delete that branch and do it all over again so we go ahead and do that with neon CTL branches and list right so let's just make sure it's in there I'll go ahead and do branches and delete then the name of Dev all right and maybe just Dev try that again there we go and so we've got our deleted Branch now so let's go ahead and create a new one neon CTL branches and create the name of Dev okay so I'm going to go ahead and scroll up a few times to get that database string again to our environment variables there and then I'm going to go ahead and use it once again like that so I'm putting that secret on there updated it's number seven now we can verify that it is a different branch let's go ahead and take a look in the parameter store and we'll go ahead and refresh in here and so I'm going to do a quick search we got EP soft Glade and we got EP soft Glade great so let's go ahead and refresh our node again and let's go ahead and add one more so if I remember correctly off the top of my head this is going to have 13 or 14 items so this should be item 13 and we see that with ID of 13 we do it one more time we got the ID of 14 and so now that same exact branch that we originally tested on is gone and if we look at the new Dev Branch we we can see that it's down to 14 and of course the time and all of that has changed great this is awesome so the next part of this of course is now turning this into a GitHub action that it does all of that for us so we don't actually have to touch it anymore uh so let's go ahead and take a look at how we're going to do that now now we're going to go ahead and use GitHub actions to automate our deployment stages first we'll automate the production deployment and see how that works then we're going to go a little bit more advanced and use a different git Branch to deploy a different stage the dev stage itself once it's deployed then we will go ahead and submit a poll request to the production Branch to have that run then at that point so I actually already started with some of the workflows themselves so if you were interested in going from what we have now just go into the workflows on GitHub and we're going to go through these things right now so the idea behind GitHub actions is it's a serverless way to just run some code the code we run is really up to what we Define in these GitHub actions so in our case what's happening in this production one is it's going to go ahead and grab a copy of our code it's going to set up no. JS and specifically version TW 20 and then it's going to go ahead and run our mpm install and then run our mpm run deploy which of course is this Command right here and so that's it that's the production stage itself now one of the dependencies this production stage has is the actual environment variables from AWS so let's go ahead and start this off right now let's go ahead and put that into our GitHub actions repo so inside of our settings here there's a couple things that we want to do the very first thing is under GitHub actions we're going to go into General we want to go ahead and scroll down and allow for workflow permissions to read and write permissions as well as allow GitHub actions to create and improve poll requests those things are important for what we'll do in the staging process the next thing is we want to scroll to the secrets and variables in the GitHub actions um section and then we'll go ahead ahead and scroll down to repository Secrets this is where we're going to put in our environment variables okay so what we want to do is these two in variables here so the first one is going to be the access key ID I actually want to create a brand new access key ID specifically for GitHub actions so inside of I am I'm going to navigate to my user here into security credentials go into access Keys create a brand new one we'll go ahead and say other next up we'll go a and give it a actual description this time so GitHub actions secret basically or GitHub actions workflow basically and we'll go ahead and hit create we're going to grab that access key there and we're going to bring it into our GitHub action secret we'll go ahead and create that one next we're going to go ahead and create the secret access key itself and we'll scroll down and paste this in here and then I'll go ahead and copy this secret access key and paste that just like that okay great so now our GitHub action should have everything necessary to deploy our production application so I'll go ahead and run this workflow now the nice thing about these workflows is they are fast and efficient and they have really good logs to figure out what's going on and what might be wrong with them so one of the things that would have been wrong is if I didn't actually fill out these secrets now something that's cool about how the environment variables work in the serverless application is that it will use the AWS access key and secret key instead of using EnV so that's actually a really nice feature of the seress framework so the next thing I actually want to do is I want to put the stage here and I'm going to go ahead and say it's prod now the reason for that is because in my Dev stage I also want that to be Dev which I already have in there but I just want to make sure that I do have that in the production one that also means that since I'm declaring the stage in more places I want to make sure that when I'm grabbing my database secret that stage has an environment variable one right so it's certainly possible that you're just like oh I'm just going to use the production one but hopefully you didn't do that based off of a a number of things that we did with the last part of actually setting and automating the secrets themselves so with that stage in mind I also want to update serverless.yml and I want to change the I Ro here to also match that stage because originally it was just for the production stage we only had one stage really creating a role now we're going to have multiple stages creating roles so we just want to update that as well so we're going to save everything and then in my GitHub I'll go and update these and we'll go ahead and say prepare for stages and we'll hit commit and we can sync those changes at this time okay so back in GitHub notice that my deployment actually did happen deploy our production app and it happened in 43 seconds we can click on this deploy section here and in here we actually see our endpoint come through so I can open that up and sure enough this should actually work for me and then if I go into leads I think I just get one lead back based off of some of the configuration we set up which of course we could verify in our code itself for leads the actual default page we actually have G lead in here instead of get leads okay so now that with this change it's a minor change that maybe I want to be in Dev first in to the dev stage first so what we want to do is in our prod stage yaml I want to change this a little bit to being based off of poll requests so in other words my Dev stage workflow is going to have to generate that poll request so that's going to take a number of steps and it gets a little bit more complicated than what we just did so if you want things really simple and you just want to run just straight to production which I don't advise but you definitely could you could automate this with a push request and basically change this to the branch that you're going to be using for your main branch or your primary branch on GitHub which would just be Main and then if you had this active it would automatically run that workflow that we just did workflow dispatch okay so I'm going to go ahead and just leave only workflow dispatch for now and work on the dev stage and really figure out how what we're going to be doing here now we already have a few of the environment variables in place we do not have the neon API key which we'll need in a moment we have our stage here we also already have a built-in GitHub token this is provided to us by GitHub actions it actually we don't need to set it we don't need to find it anywhere which is really nice for later when we use the uh GitHub CLI which actually comes in by default which we'll see and moment as well so again we'll we actually check out the code itself we grab all versions of the code mostly for the poll request a uh action that we'll do very soon once again we set up node.js we do the installations the default project installations then I want to make sure that I have the neon command line tool and TSX this of course is so that we can automate creating the branches like we've seen before as well as actually getting the connection string and then outputting that into our AWS sec secrets that parameter store so all of this stuff is mostly things that we've already seen before something that's a little bit new now is this API key call so basically anywhere we need to run a neon CTL command inside of GitHub actions workflow we just pass in an API key in there and that's how we're able to do all of these things so how I designed this workflow was to delete the previous Dev Branch so that I can take a point in time version of the branch or of the actual database itself to actually create a new version of the dev Branch at that time when I run this workflow so that then my staged Dev deployment actually has a new Branch from the database itself it actually is working off a new instance of the database having more of that data that's been stored from the production Branch now of course that's optional you don't have to do that I just want to show you how it's done next of course is getting the actual connection string itself from that branch and then putting that into our secrets and then finally we're going to go ahead and grab info about the branch itself so this is the one I want to run so in order for this to work correctly we need to bring in the neon API key so let's goe and do that now I'm going to go into my production app here we'll go into settings I'm going to go down into those Secrets again and we're going to go and create a new repository secret for the neon API key now where we find this is in the neon console we go into our user account go into the profile go into developer settings generate a new key here and I'll call this GitHub actions and then we'll go ahead and grab this and bring it into GitHub actions now do be aware that this key right here has access to our neon project so it could quite literally delete all of our databases which might be something you want to have happened but it also might not want you also might not want that but just keep that in mind when you do actually use that API key itself okay so with this in mind now we're going to go ahead and run that GitHub action so I want to bring that Dev stage in here so we'll go ahead and do get status and I'm just going to go ahead and say updated all for Dev we're going to commit it and we'll go ahead and sync those changes and then back into GI up actions I'll go ahead and deploy this Dev stage now so the key thing that I've been doing so far is actually just working on the single branch of main here so what we actually want to do is work on a different branch we want to work on a Dev Branch specifically with Git the dev Branch will will correlate to the dev application the dev stage of the application as well as the dev branch in neon so it's going to be Dev all across the board just to keep things consistent and so I know exactly what's going on now the way we do this locally is by doing get checkout dasb as in Branch Dev and this switches us over to the dev Branch so all of the changes we do in here will only go into this de Branch until we merge it into the other Branch itself so that's into the main branch that is so for example if I change this right here I just change that one single push on this workflow we'll go and say updated Dev Branch go ahead and Commit This and I'll go ahead and P publish this branch and push it into GitHub so now back in GitHub if I refresh in here um what I should see is something related to my Dev Branch so I have this Branch here and I have the ability to now bring in and merge these two branches together right so I can actually merge the dev Branch with the main branch itself so it's one commit ahead as we see here by just changing it we can go ahead and create a manual poll request and go ahead and hit create poll request here and then now I've got a poll request right so in my case it says 11 just because I did a bunch of testing yours hasn't or yours probably will say one maybe and then we can just go ahead and merge this and go ahead and confirm that merge and then we can also delete that Branch if we wanted to and so all of that did was now in our main branch we still only have one branch in here and then in my workflow we can double check in this Dev stage here that that Branch was actually pushed it actually did something in here so it actually did make a change into that workflow so let's go ahead and actually do this once again and still on the dev branch and still doing it manually before we automate it so the way we're going to do this is by going into index.js this time I'm going to go ahead and get rid of this homepage P message right I just want the Delta and that's it so I'll go ahead and save that and we'll do get status get add get commit updated homepage and then get push okay so once again it pushes it and then we can go right here and click to create a new poll request and do that right here now before I actually create that poll request I want to modify my production one just a little bit so back into the production workflow here I've got this poll request and we can do this types of closed so when the poll request is closed it triggers a GitHub event for that poll request and we can verify if it's merged here so if it is merged then we could run all of the production deployment stuff so we'll save that and now we'll go ahead and do get status get add Dall get commit prepare for auto deploy via merged PR go ahead and push okay so now I refreshed it everything should be up to par and I'm going to go ahead and now create this poll request I could have created the poll request before but now I have it no descriptions in here yet but this poll request now when I actually merge it what should happen is it should actually start a deployment process but since I just pushed some code into the dev stage itself I might want to actually wait for this to finish before I run anything else with serverless or maybe not I don't know let's go ahead and give it a shot I'm going to go ahead and merge this poll request and delete the branch so we goe merge confirm merge and delete branch and it's deleted going back into our GI up actions now we've got this deploy production app it's starting to deploy it based off of that merged poll request cool so if we wanted to automate this it's just one more step and it's a sort of major step inside of the Dev stage but not really that major and all it is is taking this Branch information here and then using the GitHub actions PR create command which is the GitHub command line tool to actually create a poll request for US based off of this actual branch and the branch that we're going to so what we want to do then is actually run the command here so I'm going to go ahead and say title and we'll give the title of automated PR from Dev right or really from Dev stage okay so that's the title we'll give it and then I'll go ahead and pass in a body and coming soon for now and then I'll go ahead and pass in the actual uh base branch which is going to be our default branch and then the pr branch is going to be the next one and that's going to be head branch and there we go and then we can also do our GitHub repo in here and just say repo and the repository okay so there we go we've got our branches that we're going to do here and let's go ahead and see how this ends up working once again I'm still in that Dev Branch here so I'll go ahead and do get status get add get commit and we'll do updated Dev workflow for auto PRS get push okay and that's going to take a moment for that to finish so going back into get up actions we see that the production app did was successful because it's really not that different than what we've been doing the poll request itself I should have none in here if I have any Dev poll requests in here this GitHub action will fail you can't have more than one for any given Branch now there are more advanced ways to have multiple branches and stuff like that um I'm not doing those Advanced ways I'm just going to be doing this really hopefully simple and straightforward one okay and so we've got this brand info here which I need to change the name of it but it does do the pr looks like everything was successful itself and then we can see the branch is the pr branch is the dev and then the main branch is right there for the default Branch great so now we can go into our poll requests here and there it is our automated PR from the dev stage the actual body itself needs to change we'll change that in a moment but overall now I can actually merge this data and again I can delete the branch if I want to it's really up to you on if you keep the branch or not um because locally I can still work on that branch and then push it again so the last part of this is really going to be do our uh poll request so it's going to be our Dev stage poll request and what we want in the body data itself instead of coming soon we want to actually get the info from our deployment right so the deployment info itself uh which is going to be in here so we need to update that as well and so let's see our Dev stage looks like our Dev stage has been running our deployment in here as well no our Dev stage is actually missing the deployment and the info so that was a key part that is missing but let's go back into package.json and make the deployment happen for our Dev stage as well but overall the GitHub action stuff uh is working correctly it's just there was one piece that was missing which is deploy Dev stage and then of course this is going to change it to just simply Dev and all that next up is we're going to go ahead and get info Dev stage and info now the reason for this is going back into the dev stage itself we'll go ahead and just grab one more name here and we'll go ahead and do deploy Dev stage and then we'll go ahead and run the you know mpm run deploy Dev stage and then that's going to take as long as it takes and then down here we're going to go ahead and get export the dev stage info equals to the dollar sign of mpm repo and now info Dev stage and then that is what's going to be inside of this body right here we're going to go ahead and pass that in just like that now we've got a new body stage and let's go ahead and try this out with get status get add-- all get commit and updated put the message in here updated for full Dev deployment stage get push and of course we'll let that go through I need to make sure that my poll request is empty looks like it is of course if I were to cancel any of the poll requests in here or deny them the production stage won't run it will only run if they are merged and that's it great so there's obviously a lot of options on how you could actually go about running those things as well now I'll just go ahead and let this finish so we can just kind of polish off this GitHub actions workflow and there we go the workflow looks to be successful so let's go into our poll requests here now we can see the automated poll request from the dev stage and what do you know there is the endpoint URL so so much of this poll request was reliant on this so that somebody could then go in and review some of those changes right so we would actually a be able to open up that page into like a new tab and review what's going on I made something change to the leads and I get this internal server error so clearly that's something I do not want to actually have go into production so then let's go back into our local environment here and see what's going on with that problem and then we'll go ahead and just change and see how we might fix it so of course the leads itself is having a problem get leads is simply not a function so let's go back into our actual uh DB crud and it's list leads there it is okay so we found the error itself go back into our index page fix this error in our Dev stage still get status get add get commit updated to list leads and then get push and then again you know that's going to go ahead and run through and finish and so this is why we actually have those PRS in place is to just do some checks to make sure everything is good in this case we do not want this we're just going to close this poll request uh and we will delete that Branch as well and that's it so we actually do not want that one of course we could put comments and stuff like that uh but once you close it what will not happen is the deployment actually running right so this won't build it it won't go through and the reason of course is it was skipped because of the way we set it up and that nothing merged nothing changed and so that is also showing that this is working correctly as well so that's actually pretty exciting to me I think is we can now see the dev stage in its full capacity we can do all sorts of tests there um in the sense that I could even share this with developers and stuff like that to they go through the different tests that they might need for this particular API and so yeah granted this is beyond the scope of really building out a expressjs application because the GitHub action itself could be used in many different places but the thing that's really nice is our Dev stage itself has a lot of features built into it that are really only possible by using neon's database service and as well as using AWS Lambda and of course is because when I'm not using the database or the aw with Lambda it's not charging me it's practically zero cost to be able to have this deployment stage or this Dev stage that I can then use when I need it to use and then that's when the cost will start to incur but only for a few minutes or so of course I get this little error here and I think it's related to actually deleting out that Branch uh too far in advance so I'm going to go ahead and just make another little change I'll just add a line here and do get status get add Dall get commit and minor fix and then I'll go ahead and push this just to verify that the actual GitHub action is working before we call this part all said and done and there we are with that minor fix that should be in there so I'm going to go ahead and now merge this poll request and again we can test this out as we see fit and I'll go ahead and run this and confirm that merge and I'm going to leave the branch now you could absolutely delete it if you needed to um but I think one of the problems that we saw with that previous minor fix or at least the up updated it to list leads the problem was that well when I went to merge it um I think it deleted it during the GitHub action workflow running which caused that issue um but now we've got a brand new one where it's going to go ahead and go into production and all that now the other thing about this is the actual production workflow does not have to actually go into using servus at all we can now pick wherever we want is far as when this thing gets merged and all that and of course the actual source code itself is going to change based off of that being merged and there's our list leads in there like that and also that just little extra space in there to make sure that that is all working as well uh so it's fairly straightforward on how we go about going from here uh the most important part of all of this was making sure that we could automate the dev stage itself so now at any time when I need to make a change to my code I work in that Dev branch and then you know commit it and do all that let the dev stage actually do its thing so then my main branch can actually work based off of that when whenever I need to so I basically won't need to work off of the main branch any longer unless there's some serious reason that I really need to but of course if I were working through this Dev branch and running through this Dev stage I should be pretty good from here on out yeah GitHub actions is pretty great for a lot of reasons let's take a look at another place to deploy this application than just AWS Lambda but still working in everything that we've been working with now as you may know expressjs was not really designed for the serverless world but the reason we can actually run it in servus is number one it's a minimal framework there's not a lot of overhead to run Express itself number two is that we have servess environments out there that we can run it on like AWS Lambda it has no JS and it can actually run Express for us but almost as important if not more important is actually our database so as soon as expressjs needs a database something like neon in servess post CR is how we're actually able to run and execute all of these things effectively without overloading our database and being ready to scale up if we need to now of course a better option for Ser list is probably nexts nextjs was designed for front-end and backend operations those backend operations are designed to be running on serverless they're like small little functions that can just run on serverless and it's really really fast but the thing is you actually have to learn react to really get the most out of xjs and maybe you're not ready to do that yet but what we will do is we're going to go ahead and integrate every everything we just did with our project and bring it right into reactor where it feels very native to our nextjs projects if you start building them out and this is thanks to versell of course versell manages nextjs but also they made it really simple to have some rewriting of rules for our API routes as we'll see in just a moment now generally speaking expresss is not going to be deployed directly to versell but I want to show you a way to do that as well and that's something we'll do in a moment but first let's go ahead and see how we can actually integrate nextjs with our entire ecosystem that we've already created in our serverless expressjs application so I actually created a repo specifically for this one and the only thing that you need to change for this repo is in versel Json this rewrites here that's all we need to change to make all of this work and more specifically the actual destination like we've got here now you can simply clone this project or you could just go to your local computer run n PX create next app at latest run through all the default options and then you just want to bring in this versell Json here and so what we want to do is we want to have these rewrites in here because of how nextjs handles API calls so inside of nextjs you can actually add in an a place to run backend API calls which is why we're actually doing this rewrite so basically we can treat our backend that we already have in in existence as one of the routes that you use for the back end of your nextjs application so that's what we want to implement now to do this I want to jump back into my serverless node.js API application so in here I'll go ahead and grab that with my serverless and info and then we'll go ahead and grab the you know stage being pra and then the region being the region we've been using which is Us East 2 hit enter and this will give me the actual endpoint I want to use so go ahead and cop Cy this endpoint and we'll paste it in just like that okay so I'm going to leave it as is and then what I want to do also is I want to make sure that versel is installed with mpm install DG versell at latest the reason for that is so we can actually use versel to well run these rewrites traditionally nextjs does not need to run those rewrites it won't actually do it by default so using versell will allow for that to happen so we'll go ahead and just call cell to start out it's going to ask us to set up a project I'm going to select all of the defaults in here I don't need to set up an existing project I'm going to use the you know directory's name I'm going to keep it in the local directory itself I'm not going to modify any settings and now it's going to go ahead and push this into versell itself and maybe even make a production version of this so we can verify this by going into our versell account which of course I'm in a free account here there is my application right and so we of course want to have a production build um and we'll do that in just a moment but before I do that I'm going to go ahead and create a new item here and we'll just call it versell and Dev so this is the versell development environment that's running our nextjs application with a port value which in this case is giving us Local Host 3,000 now my other application that we've been working on is not running at all right so that's another part of this it's not running through local it's going to quite literally go to our production endpoint here so I'll go ahe and open up Local Host now and I'll go into SL API leads what I get is not found but this is coming directly from expressjs so quite literally is calling expressjs our actual endpoint directly from a versell managed API right so this this actual inpoint is from versell so just having this alone can allow me to create a custom domain so right in versell I could just add in a customer domain right now and that will allow me to have this/ API leads so in other words if I wanted my example.com SL API leads I could quite literally just deploy it as is now of course I need to update my actual API itself to manage things a little bit differently which we'll see in a moment um but the idea is using versell with this rewrite is just a a quick and easy way to sort of do a proxy service itself uh which gives us another Advantage as well okay so going back into API and SL leads I actually want to not have it not found but actually go to those leads themselves so as it stands right now the API is at slash leads that's that's how we designed it we didn't create a path for API so we can actually change that destination just like that we can run it again and then I'll refresh in here and now it actually should do an API request to my actual endpoint on AWS Lambda with that neon database and getting back that neon data and of course I can also post dat as well but overall What's Happening Here is it's actually now treating this as just another path an API path in nextjs so if you're familiar with nextjs you'll know that typically speaking the API itself is going to be that backend part of things so I'm not going to go into the nextjs stuff of it just this right here that part is great so we can also test this so inside of page.js I'm going to go ahead and do a quick little test for this page.js is just the homepage of our nextjs application and it's all in react so if you're not familiar with react this might be a little confusing so just bear with me if it is I'm going to go ahead and get rid of all of the stuff in between main save that and I'll refresh in here notice everything's gone if I put H1 of hello world save that refresh in here and now it says hello world great so all I really want to do here is have a button of some kind that's going to emulate you know press me that's going to emulate actually calling our API there's that button right right there great okay so this is all Tailwind CSS classes in here so I can do BG green like 500 or 400 uh to actually have a background again that's another thing that's outside the scope of this but nextjs has a lot of features that come into it by default which can make it a little overwhelming to start out with but the idea here is we want to actually press this and actually do an API call that's really what I want to see and to make this happen inside of next we're going to go ahead and get rid of this import here and I'm going to go ahead and pass in the string of use CL client at the top to basically treat this page as a front-end page then I'm going to go ahead and bring in something from react itself we go ahead and import use State and this is going to be from react itself and then I'll go ahead and do const and new or let's go ahead and just say data and then set data equals to use State and there going to be just an empty string for the moment and then I want to actually have a click event in here so I'll go and do const handle click which is an event and we'll go ahead and console log that event and so we can add in a click Handler on the button itself so we'll do onclick and that's equal to that function itself now this is straight up react if you don't know this stuff it's okay I just wanted to do one simple thing with the fetch call on this onclick here and then the data itself we're going to go ahead and just say if the data exists we'll go ahead and do json. stringify of that data we really just want to see that it is working as we see fit so the way we're going to do that is by doing Fetch and then we want to fetch to/ API leads what do you know it's going to the rewrite itself I do not have to put that entire URL in there just the destination can be left inside of R sell. Json so what that does is it allows us to treat this like you normally would in a versell application um so or an xjs application in versel I don't really have to think about how to actually handle this I don't need to think about what URL I'm using or anything like that but realistically it's not a whole lot different than calling any normal API itself but in this case it's actually going to augment it in a way that's really cool as we'll see so now that we've got this let's go ahead and actually get the data back from this which I'll just say response equals to a weight fetch which means I need to turn this handle click into an asynchronous function and then I'll go ahead and do set data being a weight response uh response. Json like that this of course could have errors itself which we're not going to handle right now but overall I got a now click event that I can do in here let's just make sure everything's running I'll refresh in my create app and I'll hit press me and what should happen maybe at first it doesn't necessarily come through uh because it needs to spin up and all that uh but after I press it it will actually come through in there which we could console log the event each time it's happening and I'll go and press it now and you can see that it's clicking and it actually is doing that call for us and it's getting that data from our API in a way that's very nextjs based in other words the developer the nextjs developer if you were working with somebody else they could just work with their normal development process altogether and of course we could post data in here as well so for example to post that data we could just change this method being post and then the header uh is going to be our you know our content type and this going to be application Json and then our body data is going to be uh json.stringify a dictionary here and that's going to be email abc1 123@gmail.com and again it will still have a response so this is how I can post data and of course if you know react you will be able to change this as UC see fit as well so let's go ahead and try that out out I'll post out some data here and there is the result back from it right so this is coming directly from my API itself uh and there we go so it's now almost fully integrated here so that's pretty cool so now at this point what we could do is we could actually add this into our repo which I will so I go get add and we'll do get uh you know first prod deploy and we'll go ahead and push this into production and so what's going to happen here is it's going to go into vers sell uh it's going to go to the repo itself and it's going to do all of the build that it needs to to make sure that this is working properly uh which might take a moment or so uh but overall the idea being that once this is ready the production application version will be able to use API leads right in there uh and we already can but of course we could then customize our domain and do all that stuff but once it actually gets fully ready it will work the way we needed to and so the way I would actually change the r API itself is I would change this to being API leads and run off of that so that process would be then get status get add get commit and then updated versel inpoint for you know nextjs API so I'm basically going backwards now and so in my actual serverless node API itself I would then need to add in these paths here which I already did off the video and then I would actually have to go back into that application itself uh into serverless no jsapi look at those poll requests and then we would want to actually commit these things right so this is of course assuming that the dev stage was correct I'm not actually going to go through that process but the idea being that we now release the production version a new version of the API itself and really just kind of separating these two things out so realistically what our node.js application is doing is just consuming a pre-existing API it's not actually deploying our expressjs application on versell uh but it is getting close to that it's getting close to what we might want to do with our application here and so every time you run a release it should actually start building out a production version of it uh assuming that we are in the right you know branch and all that and it actually does go into our repo look looks like it has and so that would take just a moment for the deployments to start filling out uh right on here so it looks like my deployment is not actually filling out so let's go into our settings here and into G and oh yes we need to connect our git repository so I'll go in GitHub here and then let's go ahead and connect the serverless uh one that we have which is the API next so I'll go ahead and connect that one now and I might have to run another production push but there's our main here um and so now we have our project connected to get so it actually should do that deployment when I do make those changes so let's just do a quick change here and just call it a day and this one I'll go ahead and say Hello World V2 and we'll go ahead and do a commit again and push it again so that we can trigger a deployment automatically and so that should actually happen now that I actually did that push and there it goes so it's now going to build that next version and by now hopefully our API leads is working correctly again it's still working correctly based off of that new rewrite that we just did right here uh and let's go ahead and just refresh that server just to make sure that that did happen and so I can refresh in here and all of that happened because of everything we set up with our seress framework and all of that serverless automation within there our production build takes a minute to actually deploy a new version of the API whereas the nextjs application might take a little bit longer than that uh depends on how big our nextjs application ends up being but overall once we actually deploy this we'll have a new version right on versell as we see here and now we can visit this and here's my production version on verell and there it is it's actually committing and making new data in my API backend and you know API leads is definitely showing that backend as well so great this is actually showing us how easy and how powerful can be to start leveraging that API into our projects into our xjs projects the other huge benefit of this is the developer who knows nextjs might not know how you built out this back end and there it is I want to point out also I never actually put any AWS keys in here I never put anything related to Neon in here I could quite literally just share this back end this API as I see fit and build down to my front end so like if you're working with another developer that's not necessarily on your team but you want them to build out a feature this is how this is one of the ways you could do it you could just send them whether it's your production API or your development API you could send them this link and say hey this is how you're going to do it and now you can actually build out what I need and then we can go from there of course you can still use wild cards there's a lot of different things you can do with these rewrites so just check the ver sale documentation for that um but this is the methodology I would take to leverage everything we've done to then start actually learning and building out an xjs application and then maybe modifying and migrating over to nextjs because a lot of the code itself can migrate not exactly because of how it's written we've got all this require here you have to change some of the import statements and all that but overall it's like now going towards what you would want to do within a nextjs application which is really exciting the final piece that I want to do is actually deploy our serverless node.js API itself this pure API itself directly to versell as well and just see what that looks like and how well it's not actually a whole lot different than what we just did but it's not going to give us the functionality of the reactjs framework we'd have to worry about that ourselves so let's take a look at how to do that now now we're going to take a look at how to deploy our expressjs application directly into versell now this can be combined with what we did with nextjs but I wouldn't recommend it generally speaking you probably don't want to deploy expressjs to versell even if it's technically possible nextjs is a much better alternative specifically to leverage a lot of the things that versell does really well and part of the reason I showed you the previous one first is because that's a better method to start leveraging your expressjs application and building off of that so the first thing that I want to do inside of here is I want to go ahead and add a new project this project is going to take a few things in here so let's go ahead and grab this serverless nodejs API the actual repo itself that we've been using and I'll go ahead and just deploy this as is now the problem with this of course is it's not going to work it's not going to work at all because of what versel attempts to do so we need to make it work and we need to change a few things on our project so the first thing that I want to change is I'm going to go ahead and add in versel Json and let's go ahead and change that to actually Json and I'm going to bring in that rewrites again so this time the destination is a little bit different and it's going to be a catchall and it's going to go into the destination of just simply SL API so in order for this to work we need to create a folder called simply API and in this folder we're going to go ahead and do index.js and this we need to import using the actual es6 modules from dot dot dot source and in our case it's Index right there so what we're importing here is the expressjs application which is defined right there and we also export it or we need to export it with module. exports and app equaling to app just make sure that it is exported so then it can be imported and then we'll go ahead and do export default of app okay so far so good so we've did that same rewrite we just did we also are adding in the index itself the actual app itself inside of the API and that rewrite is going to just return everything from that app to the API itself okay next up of course is going to be that we need a public directory so forel is really good at leveraging the public directory to serve the project so when it comes to nextjs it actually generates a public directory for you that will then manage all of the frontend side of things for sales optimized for front end and serverless in the back end and we're trying to emulate that here a little bit with just Express so the first thing I'm going to do is put get keep in here this is if I didn't want to actually put a front end of any kind but I'll also go ahead and add in index.html and then I'll just put in poorly formatted HTML here just to have a Hello World call of some kind okay so I didn't actually change this in terms of the expressjs application itself it's still using this SL API paths here like we saw before so we might need to change that as well uh but the reason I changed those in the first place was really for that integration with the xjs application based off of a rewrite okay so with this m let's go ahead and change it we'll do get status get add Dall get commit and we're going to prepare for versel and then we go ahead and do get push so what vercel is going to do is it's going to wait until this is on the main branch right now we're working on that Dev Branch so what versel will also do is well it doesn't really care about this production stage at all it's going to do its own thing it's going to basically do a similar item of this to deploy it which means we need one more step and that is our package.json versel is actually looking for something called build or versel we'll do versel build it's also looking for a script called build itself in this case we're just going to go ahead and do Echo the word of Simply hello and that's it in other words our build command is not going to do anything and the reason for this is that we maybe we add in another build script in here of some kind but ver cell build is going to attempt to build something and if this command does not exist then it's going to fail so during the versell build command it does something like our mpm run deploy but instead it's going to be versell build if that's available so we'll go ahead and leave that as is and then I need to redeploy this again but to do that I need to go back into GitHub uh and specifically into this repo itself so we go ahead and look for that repo and here it is right here and so what I want to do is just accept the pr that I just did um and commit pull and confirm okay and so there we go notice that versel actually looked at that as well so I'll go ahead and do another one with get status and get add and then get commit and then we'll go ahead and do updated script for versell and we'll go ahead and push that okay so it's going to take it a moment to build out so back in for sale we actually need to update this a little bit more too right so back into our project we've got our project right here well the problem with our project as it stands is the fact that well it doesn't have our environment variables that we need so our environment variables are going to be related to AWS right so the reason we need that of course is for that runtime so let's think about our production stage itself we've got en.pr which might have the stage variable in here for prod it also might need well not might it definitely will need various things related to our secrets so in our secret Library here we've got the AWS client that's coming through now when we deploy it to AWS those variables are going to be in there as in the AWS access key ID and the secret access key and of course it also has a role in here that we created specifically for the different stages and all that but we aren't pushing that into production anymore so we need to make sure verell has AWS access Keys itself so of course what we could do is we could go into AWS and create some new ones I'm just going to go ahead and use these local ones that I've got here just so I can emulate or show this example working correctly and there we go and I'll go ahead and save this the environment itself I don't necessarily need a bunch of different environments but I'll go ah and save those variables for all of those environments and there we go so one of the things I don't need in this version of my expressjs application is a neon API of any kind or my database URL because of course we've already done this but the idea being that my secrets are now stored on AWS so if you wanted to get rid of that functionality You' have to readjust how you're doing this and you'd probably be read addding your database URL as an environment variable but again this isn't a deployment that I recommend but it is one that you could do the question of course is whether or not you should so now with this deployed I see that it does say hello world so it looks like I'm on the right track that hello world of course is coming from the public index.html here so let's go ahead and visit this and at least the front end is going to work here so we've got the front end working which is kind of cool um I I want to visit the actual main the deployment as well so let's go back into the project and grab the actual deployment uh URL which is this one right here and so there we go and now I'll go ahead and jump into the API SL leads and if I did everything correctly it will work but of course the problem that it is facing right now is merely the fact that I didn't have those environment variables when I deployed this version so let's go ahead and just create them now I'm going to go ahead and update my index page and we'll go ahead and do p and EnV working try this again and actually one thing I might need to do also is just verify any poll requests that I have in here so this will also trigger another deployment so I'll go ahead and run that what this will actually do is solve that environment variable thing so I probably don't even need to submit this yet so I'm not going to do that yet let's go ah and see if this recent deployment solves the environment variable thing that we had with versel so get going back in here we'll just go ahead and take a look at the deployments that are coming through and of course it's building one notice it doesn't take very long that's not surprising because it's only installing a few things here it's not using the cache in the same way that AWS Lambda is it's literally installing all of the things in our package.json all over again and there we go we've got a new production version so I'll go ahead and open up my app again I can actually just go back into this URL here and if I refresh now everything's working and there is my expressjs application running on versel so what we could do is yes we could keep this I don't recommend it but we could keep it and then build out your front end using something different so expresss has a lot of different front-end support as well in other words the index.html could then bring in something like pug or some other JavaScript that you might want to have in there that then calls the API itself uh but that starts to get way too complicated then it's like oh you might as well use for yourself you're going to start building out the front end um itself forell and xjs uh to build it out and make it even more powerful but I really wanted to show you how those two different approaches worked so that if you wanted to use something like versell to deploy your applications you totally could now all all of this is possible because of how easy it is to be flexible with our deployment options neon is well suited to do all of that for us right so the fact that our database we didn't have to touch our database at all for those last few deployments was so nice and that's because of how we configured everything to work and in this like automated fashion so when it comes to deploying to versel the other part of this that you could consider is you don't always have to have your database URL exposed inside of the application itself so even if you were using nextjs you could still use the parameter store that we did and then in your workflows you could still do the dev stage where you would basically stop uh as far as the dev stage is concerned you would stop you would create a branch maybe the deployment Branch you could then also create that uh pole stage actually everything in here with maybe the exception of deploying a development stage on AWS could still work in a nextjs application and nextjs itself can also do a bunch of things with that and of course if we wanted to deploy our development version on versell well we could go back into versell into our project here the first thing that I need to do for this project is jump into the settings go into my environment variables here and we want to add one specifically for a preview environment I'll go ahead and grab the branch itself which will be our Dev environment I want to go ahead and add the stage of Dev right and then we'll go ahead and save that so now we've got a preview environment on that stage right so it's going to give us that Dev there so the next thing that I would want to do is jump into our deployments here and we're going to go ahe and create a new deployment so it's going to be commit or Branch reference this is going to be Dev so let's do a quick search for the dev Branch there it is right here it was happened just a little bit ago I'm going to create a deployment for that and this should work right so it's going to be basically the same thing just using the dev Branch itself so in other words the branch itself should also have the same data that our production one has because well we've been deleting and recreating those branches uh but overall what what I really want to see here is that the dev Branch actually works and it is something that's different and again it's just another way to just Branch out our database do some tests and preview environments and all that so here it is there's our preview environment I think it's working so let's go ahead and give this a shot by looking at the Domain itself um and so there's our world let's go into our API just make sure that that's working so API leads and what we should have in here is something maybe slightly different than the other one this has 18 values in here um and so once again I could just go back into this one let's go ahead and just create a preview or uh you know a stag version I'll go ahead and update this and go ahead and do staged version and we'll go ahead and push it okay so of course one of the challenges with pushing this is the fact that I have my Dev stage here is going to quite literally create and delete a branch which could cause Havoc or issues with staging this version uh so it's not necessarily something I recommend doing but we could we could just try it out just to see that you can absolutely deploy different versions of your application with different stages and different branch databases at that time as well um which in our case the stage version uh it just came out 20 seconds ago so we can go ahead and take a look I'm not I'm not confident that the API is going to work here but we can give it a try at least we've got some you know other text in there so let's go ahead and grab in the SL API and leads and I I would imagine that it's either going to work or it's not in this case it actually did work uh which is great so we have the ability to now also have those different stages as well on versell and each stage could have it a different domain as well as the main production one can also have its own custom domain which is maybe one of the main reasons you end up deploying to versell as well is because it's quite a bit easier to put a custom domain on versell than it is on AWS and the servess environment so yeah that's pretty cool I think for sale is a great tool and now I would recommend that you start modifying converting all this stuff to nextjs which is really the the next part of so much of this but even if you didn't we now have a really solid foundation for an API service that we can start building out a lot more endpoints if we needed to hey thanks so much for watching hopefully you got a lot out of this now I want to leave you with two challenges one is how do you actually Implement authentication whether it's users or other applications how do you actually secure our API more now that will be a really good challenge to undertake at this point if you were able to get this far the other one is well how do you actually convert this expressjs application into a nextjs application those are the two challenges I want to leave you with they are fairly straightforward especially because there's a lot of thir third party support out there but I think those are really good challenges that you can Undertake and guess what they can feed into each other as well so thanks again for watching my name is Justin Mitchell I really enjoyed sharing this with you because I think servus is one of the most fantastic things that you can learn about and Implement because it really just helps us focus on just our code we don't have to worry about the infrastructure that infrastructure is taken care of by the different services that we leveraged right so AWS Lambda will scale up if we get a lot of users coming in so we our on database so would versel if we went there it's really really great to just focus on the code itself and not really worry about the infrastructure that is one of the keys of serus and that's why I wanted to create this course for you so thanks again for watching and I look forward to seeing you again in the near future take care\", metadata={'source': 'cxgAN7T3rq8', 'title': 'Serverless Node.js

      "[Document(page_content=\"we all know that data structures and algorithms is a must topic for anyone wanting to become a software engineer so in this video I'll break down for you exactly what you need to learn the order in which you should learn it and give you some details on what you should focus on for each individual topic I'll even share with you some resources and tips to learn this as effectively as possible now if you want a text based version of this road map or something to follow along with then join my school Community I have it in there completely for free we have over 8,000 members in the school community you can join for free from the link in the description I look forward to seeing you there so let's get right into it with the first thing you absolutely need to master which is big on notation and time complex the analysis you need to understand how to look at a piece of code and understand how efficient that code is does it run in linear time does it run in exponential time does it run in logarithmic time you should understand how to evaluate that and you should know which code is more efficient than others now it's really important that you spend a lot of time in this section and you really get this down this is not something you can skip you need to really understand this to the point where I can put any piece of code in front of you and you can tell me what the time complexity of that is now usually we're going to do this in bigo notation it's not going to be harmful to learn about big Theta notation and the other types of notation but often times we're just going to use bigo notation so as long as you understand that that's completely fine now the reason we need to know this so deeply is because this is going to really translate to every area of data structures and algorithms the whole reason we use different data structures is because of the efficiency of them for different types of operations so if you don't really understand time complexity and efficiency it's going to be impossible to master anything else on this list so please spend a lot of time here absolutely Master this and while you're looking at time complexity you can also look at space complexity now in my eyes this is pretty much the same thing just applied to memory and space it's pretty easy to learn space complexity once you know time complexity so get those down time complexity space complexity and then move into the next topic so now that we're masters of Big O notation and time complexity it's time to get into our basic data structures I've got a long list here just bear with you I'm going to go through them one by one so the first one you're going to want to look at is arrays now you've probably seen an array before but you may not have really gone into the details and understood the time complexity of various operations so here our goal is to understand what an array is how it works and what the different operations are and their efficiency so adding an element removing an element locating an element adding an element at the front adding an element at the back resizing an array and then Dynamic arrays versus fixed size arrays so a dynamic array is one that can grow in size whereas a fixed size array is one that only has a certain number of elements here our goal should be to understand how arrays work behind the scenes and how we grow or Shrink them depending on the operations we're performing now once we look at arrays we want to start looking at linked lists now these are probably the most basic type of data structure and we want to understand how we create references between different nodes how we Traverse a linked list how we add an element how we remove an element and all of the different time complexity of those operations one thing you're going to see here is that for all of these different data structures what we're focused on is four main operations creating deleting inserting and locating in some cases there's a few more but generally speaking those are the four things we do with the data structure and we want to know which data structures are best at what different type of operation so that's why we're really focusing on the efficiency of those operations so we know later on which data structure we should pick for a specific problem that we're encountering okay so once we learned singly linked list we're now going to learn double linked list now this is a linked list that goes in both directions pretty much you can look it up you'll see exactly how it works and same thing with a single link list we're going to want to understand how to add remove find and when we would use double versus single what the advantages are once we look at that we're going to start getting into cu's and stacks now A Q is a data structure that will maintain the order in which elements are inserted this is just like a q where you would line up right you're in a line that is a q so again we want to understand how we add how we delete how we find an element how we create a queue and here we'll also want to look at how we Implement a queue because the implementation is going to dictate the time complex the various different operations now after we learn about Q of course we're going to be learning about a stack a stack is just like a stack of plates whatever goes on the top is the first thing to come off so the first element on is actually the last element off and the last element on is the first element out we have lifo last in first out that's kind of a common term here when we're talking about something like a stack there's a way to say it in reverse as well but a stack is another data structure we're going to want to learn again adding elements removing elements how we implement it and when we would use a stack versus using something like a q so now we've learned about those we're going to start getting into trees now here's where it gets a little bit more complex and we start to see some data structures that aren't quite as familiar because they're not linear they're in a tree likee structure now so this is where you'll start to see kind of some new Concepts but it gets pretty interesting so the first thing we're going to look at is just basic trees and we're going to specifically look at a binary tree a binary tree is a tree in which one node can have at most two different children and with the binary tree we have a lot of different properties and ways to Traverse the tree to add an element to the tree to remove an element to the tree to locate if if an element exists sorry to create the tree when we're starting out so we're going to want to look at all of those different things and when we start looking at trees there's going to be three traversals that we're going to want to focus on the postorder the pre-order and the inorder traversal these are very important to understand so make sure you spend some time once you've learned about the basics of trees to know how those traversals work now we're also going to want to learn about some different tree properties like the height of of a tree the depth of a node within the tree we're going to want to understand what a complete binary tree is what a full binary tree is what a perfect binary trees there's all these different properties of trees and even though you don't need to memorize all of them you should have at least seen them once so make sure you go through all of those different Core Concepts there's probably some I'm forgetting here but those are the main ones I can think of off the top of my head now once we've learned about binary trees we're going to start learning about binary search trees now a binary search tree is very similar to what we learned before but in this case we use the tree to more efficiently locate elements and we sort them or sore them sorry in more of a sorted order now it's not a linear sorted order like we would have seen before with the binary search tree all of the children to the right of a parent are going to have a greater than value and all of the children to the left of a parents are going to have a value less than that now this allows us to create an efficient data structure for locating different elements but there's some other properties of this that we're going to want to understand like how do we insert an element in a binary search tra how do we remove an element how do we locate an element Etc so look at both regular binary trees and then binary search trees once we look at binary search trees we're going to start looking at heaps now heaps are similar to binary search trees but they work a little bit different and again we're focusing on those main operations like creating a heap inserting deleting locating Etc now with the Heap we're going to want to look at a Min Heap and a Max Heap and we'll try to see how a heap can actually work as something known as a priority Q which is another data structure that we should kind of learn about in Tangent with the Heap now once we learn about heaps we're going to move on to graphs now when we talk about graphs we're going to be talking about nodes or vertices that are connected with different edges we have so many different properties of graphs like directed graphs undirected graphs weighted graphs unweighted graphs and we need to understand how to represent graphs and how to Traverse them so we could have adjacency list adjacency matrices Edge list there's all different types of properties of graphs and here's where you can get into graph Theory and get real really really complicated start talking about Cycles within graphs and all kinds of fancy algorithms you don't need to get too crazy here but you want to understand what a graph is how you represent a graph the different types of representations and which is advantageous in which scenario now once we understand graphs and we get that terminology out of the way we're going to start looking at hashing now hashing is not overly complex this isn't something I would spend a ton of time on but we want to understand what a hash is how we hash and how we use this for something like a hash map that way we understand how some data structures that we use every single day actually operate and the efficiency of those data structures so that wraps up our basic data structures I know this is overwhelming and it's a lot of content but this really is what you need to know just as the basics in data structures and algorithms and now we're going to get into the algorithms all right so now we're going to start diving into algorithms but I do want to let you know that if you do want to learn all of this and you actually want some practice and ways to evaluate if you actually know what you're learning then you can check out my course with course careers this is a full software development course it doesn't just teach data structures and algorithms but it has an entire section dedicated to this where I break down all of the topics that I'm listing to you right now I explain everything that you need to know and not only that we give you a bunch of practice exercises quizzes Etc so you actually know if you're ingesting this content and understanding what the heck we're talking about you can check it out from the link in the description with that said though let's get into our algorithms okay so now now we've learned our data structures we're going to start talking about algorithms now these algorithms will use the various data structures that we've talked about and a lot of them are just famous computer science algorithms that you should be aware of and you should implement or write once in your life so let's start going through them now there's kind of different categories of algorithms so bear with me as I walk through them the first type of algorithm we're going to want to learn about is recursion now recursion is Simply Now recursion is Simply Now recursion is simply if you got that horrible computer science leave a comment down below but recursion is simply calling the same function from the same function so it's pretty much doing the same thing over and over when we create a recursive algorithm we have something known as a base case and a recursive case you can learn more about it this is not going to be an entire video on recursion next we have searching algorithms now these you may have already seen at this point but a searching algorithm is something we use to locate something within a data structure so we have a linear search which means simply scanning something from left to right and trying to find an element and then we have something like binary search which is a way that we can sort or sorry search very quickly within a sorted list you want to learn both of those and you should know how to implement them and write them out next we have sorting algorithms now sorting is a very famous thing in computer science obviously we need to do this all the time so it's important to understand these different algorithms and the efficiency of each of them within sorting algorithms we have so many different options I'm going to list a few here and if you follow any reputable curric ulum then these will probably all be taught so we have insertion sort selection sort bubble sort merge sort Heap Sort quick sort uh there's probably a few others that I'm forgetting but those are the main famous ones that you want to be aware of you don't necessarily need to write all of these out but you should understand how they work and what sorting algorithm is used as the default implementation for a programming language you write it so next we're moving on to graph algorithms now at this point we really want to focus on depth first search and breadth first search and make sure we can implement those and really understand how they work so with depth first search we're using a stack with breath for search we're using a q we want to really make sure we're good at these because these are very famous algorithms and they're used in a ton of different problems now as well as that I'd recommend looking at Cru skull's algorithm and Prim algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree these aren't as important but they are pretty famous algorithms and they can show up in some more complicated data structures and algorithms type questions moving on from our graph algorithms we have our path finding algorithms now these are quite a bit different they are a more efficient way to find the shortest path within a graph in this case we have the AAR path finding algorithm and Dyas algorithm start with Dyas then you can look at AAR AAR is just a slight variation of Dyas so it's not that much more difficult to learn and it can always be fun to write programs that actually model these uh pathf finding algorithms in fact I found those really fun when I first learned them so maybe here you want to take a break and actually write out a data structure as an algorithms visualizer where you kind do a pathf finding algorithm just an idea anyways let's move on to the next algorithms I'm going to go a little bit faster here these are important to understand but you can really only learn them when you apply them to a specific problem so as much as you can look at the theory these are going to be more ones you focus on when you see a problem that requires this type of solution now here we have greedy algorithms we have divide and conquer algorithms this is kind of a general classification but something to be aware of we have dynamic programming and then we have backtracking algorithms now again kind of four categories of algorithms that are hard to learn theoretically and that are easier when you actually apply them into a problem okay so that wraps up the algorithm section now it's worth noting that there are tons of different algorithms you can learn but these are the most famous and if I was going to name the few that you should really focus on uh they would be the following so linear search binary search depth for search breath first search and then you want to understand sorting algorithms like the merge sort and the quick sort algorithm if you only had to learn a few algorithms on this list those would be the few I would really really dive into and make sure you fully understand the reason for that is these are the most commonly used and I would say they're the most fundamental in terms of computer science knowledge the other ones are important don't get me wrong but if you're only going to learn a few of them really focus on those specific few so at this point for 95% of you you have all the knowledge you need to really start practicing this and if you do have something like a coding interview start preparing for That interview by doing data structures and algorithm style questions however if you really want to get to the next level there are some more advanced data structures and some math you may want to learn which I'm going to share with you now now I just want to emphasize that for most of you you do not need to know this even myself I'm not master these different data structures so I'm just going to quickly run through a list of the advanced ones again that are completely optional that you may want to look at if you really want to get to the next level but keep in mind most of you do not need to know this and you'll be completely fine with what I said before okay so let's get into it here we have tries B trees AVL trees red black trees skipless segment trees Fenwick tree and the disjoint set now there's about a billion other data structures I could share here as well but these are the more popular Advanced ones now if you've learned all that and you really feel like punishing yourself still I'll give you a few math topics you can learn that'll give you a much deeper understanding but again this is fully optional I've actually learned all of this math I can't remember any of it to this day today but I do remember when I was learning I was like okay that's kind of cool and now I feel like I understand this a bit better anyways we have combinat Tronics we have probability discrete math and discrete structures now discrete math and discret structures are two courses that I took in University I could not tell you what I learned I don't remember most of it but it was based on like mathematical proofs and actually going through some pretty deep math that kind of allows us to understand why certain data structures have different uh time complexities how we actually prove the time complexity of algorithms Etc not something I feel like you really need to know I don't think I've ever used this in real life but if you do really want to get into the nitty-gritty you can learn those type of mathematical topics okay so that's going to wrap up this complete road map I just want to go through everything you need to learn that you have one video that has everything and you can kind of reference this if you're looking for a road map or a guide now keep in mind I do have the text based version in the school Community completely free you can join from the link in the description and if you want a great resource that really has all of this packaged into one place you can check out my course with course careers I'll wrap of the video here if you guys enjoy make sure to leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next [Music] one\", metadata={'source':

      "[Document(page_content=\"in this video I'll teach you how to make a d Jango API using Python and the D Jango rest framework the API will look something like this and we'll be able to create read update and delete data now at the end of the video I'll even show you how we deploy this API to a public URL and if you want to test out the API that we'll be building I'll leave a link in the description right now if you click on that link it's going to bring you to a platform called Acorn now I've teamed up with them for this video this is a completely free platform you can sign in with your GitHub account and what will happen is it will actually start running an instance of this API once it's finished running you can click on this button right here and it will bring you to a deployed public version of it where you can actually test it out so you can go to slash blog post and this will be your own instance of the API you can mess around with it you can do whatever you want and you can test it out so I'm going to show you exactly how we do that so once the video is finished you can deploy the API that we made you can share it with people and you can use it from the internet not just from Local Host with that said let's get into the video so to begin we need to do a little bit of setup here and install the necessary packages at this point I'm going to assume that you have python installed on your system and what you'll do next is open up an editor something like vs code and simply open a folder in this case I've opened a folder called API it's important that we are working inside of a folder and that our terminal is in that location for the commands that I'm going to show you to run now what we'll do is we'll create a new file where we'll specify the requirements that we need for this project so we're going to say requirements. TX XT and inside of here we're going to write out Django Django rest framework and then we also want environs like that okay so these are the three packages that we're going to need to install in order for us to work with d Jango now that we have these in the requirements.txt file what we'll do is install them using the PIP command so from our terminal here in the same directory where we have our requirements.txt file we're going to type pip 3 install hyphen R requirements.txt this will simply install all of the the packages that are inside of this file now if you're on Windows you're going to change this command to Simply Be pip if you're on Mac or Linux it'll be pip 3 so we're going to go ahead and hit enter and it should install all of these for us once that's installed we have most of the basic setup done and now what we need to do is create a new D Jango project so now that we have our dependencies installed we're going to use a command to create a new D Jango project now to do that we're going to type django-admin start project and then we're going to call this my site you can call it whatever you want but I recommend you go with the name my site now for some of you this command will work for others it will not in my case this command does not work so the way that I fix this is I'm going to remove the admin and I'm going to type Python 3-m and then Django start project my site so if you're on Mac it's going to be Python 3 if you're on Windows it's simply going to be python okay so go ahead and run that and we should see that we get a new directory being created here called my site this is where we'll write our API and where we'll run the next commands so we're going to change directories into my site so now notice I'm inside of this directory in my terminal from here we're going to create a new app now inside of our projects we have various apps apps are ways to separate out different pieces of logic in this case we're going to have a simple app this will be for the API so we always need at least one app so we're going to create one called API to do that we're going to type Python 3 manage.py notice that's the file that's right here and then we're going to say start app and we're going to give this a name I'm going to go with API and I recommend you give it the same name go ahead and hit enter and you'll see a new directory is created here called API now what we need to do is we need to connect this app with our main python project or our Django project sorry and the way we do that is we go into my site directory we go into settings.py let's make this a little bit easier to see and we go into where we see installed apps here and we add our application into the installed apps to do that we simply add a string and we give it the same name as the project name or the app name sorry which is API so notice we created a new app called API and I've added that here to the installed apps now as well as that we're going to add the D Jango rest framework in here because this is something we'll use to have some nice clean views for our API so we're going to say restore framework inside of the installed apps and for now that's all we need to change inside of settings.py now we have linked our API with our project what we want to do is start building out the model or the data that our API is going to interact with now you can obviously have multiple data sources in this case multiple models we're going to start with a single model what we're going to do is open the API folder inside of the API folder we see that we have a file called models.py now this is where we Define the different database models now D Jango uses something known as an OM now an omm is an object relational mapping and what this does is it Maps a pip python object to a database instance this is really nice because it allows us to use multiple types of databases and have D Jango handle all of the low-level commands that actually create update and retrieve data and in our case we can use a higher level python wrapper which is known as the omm to access our data create our data Etc you'll see how easy Django makes it using the Django rest framework in just a second but bear with me while we create our first database model so we're going to create a class here this is how you do it in Jango and we're going to say that this is blog post now this needs to inherit from the models. model when we do that we get all of the basic functionality of a database model which in this case is really equivalent to a table in something like a SQL database now what we need to do is Define all of the different columns that we have for our model or the fields or type of information sorry that it will store so we're going to begin with a title and we're going to say that this is the models. charfield and inside of the charfield we can specify a parameter which is the maximum length equal to something like 100 next we're going to specify that for each of our blog posts we'll have some content this will be a models. text field keep in mind you can make this anything you want but I'm just going with some basic Fields here and then we're going to have a published unor date and this is going to be equal to the models. DAT time field and we're going to add a parameter here called Auto add now which is equal to True which specifies that we don't need to set what the time and date is whenever we create a new instance of this model so we have a new row in our database it's going to automatically kind of fill in the publish date for us next we're simply going to say Define uncore string uncore uncore we're going to take in a self and we're going to return the self. tile of the model just so that if we end up printing out this model we actually see some information about it so that's really it for the model you can get much more complicated here and store a lot of different types of data you can have relationships you can have multiple models but for now we're going to do a a very simple one we're going to focus on the API views and then later on you can adjust the models and you can create multiple views for making different types of models now that we have our model we need to create something known as a serializer so I'm going to make a new file here and it's going to be called serializers do PI now inside of here what we're going to do is specify a class that will take this model and convert it into Json compatible data if you're unfamiliar with Json this is Javascript object notation and whenever we work with an API we're essentially sending and receiving Json data it looks something very similar to a python dictionary but the idea is that we're going to have all of these python objects that we'll be working with in our code and these represent information in our database we want to create what's known as a serializer that will take an instance of this python object and convert it into something that we can actually return and interact with from our API so it might seem a little bit abstract right now but bear with me it will make sense so we're going to say from the rest frame workk import the serializer where they going to say from do models import the blog post like so now we're going to go and create a class and we're going to call this the blog post serializer and this is going to inherit from the serializers doth model serializer so a lot of this is already done for us we just need to kind of hook up the different models now we're going to create something known as a meta class so we're going to say class meta and we're going to say the model is equal to the blog post and we're going to specify the fields that we would like to serialize and return when we use the serializer now the fields are going to be ID title content and the published date now you don't have to do all of these but if you don't include one of them it's not actually going to be returned uh in the API okay so you need to make sure that any field you want to be returned from your API you specify in here ID is a field that will automatically be added to all of our models we don't need to specify that when we create the model okay so we now have our serializer and we have our model the next step is to create a view that actually utilizes the model and the serializer so we're going to go inside of views.py and we're going to use some D Jango rest framework views now the really nice thing about the Jango rest framework is that it provides some default views for creating updating deleting Etc and doing the standard operations that you would with a rest API hence why we installed the Django rest framework so what we're going to do here is import a few things from Jango rest framework they give us something known as a generic View and that's that nice view that you saw when I gave you that original demo at the beginning of the tutorial so we're going to say from the rest framework import generics like so now generics contains generic views that can be used to update delete Etc any type of model so what we're going to do is create a simple view for now and we're going to say class blog post list create is equal to the generics do list create API View and then inside of here we just need to specify a few basic things the first thing we need to do is specify the query set now the query set is going to be equal to blog post which we're going to import in a second dot objects. all that means we now need to import blog post so we're going to say from doels import the blog post now what we're doing here is we're just getting all of the different blog post objects that exist this is how you do it using the omm in Django the object relational mapping if you want to get all of them you simply say the name of the model which is what we specified here doobs doall gives you all of the instances of our blog post now that is our query set and then beneath this we specify the serializer that we want to use when we're actually returning this data so we're going to say serializer class is equal to and then this is going to be the blog post serializer which we also need to import so we're going to say from dos serializers import the blog post serializer now that's actually it we've just created a view we now need to connect it with a URL what this view will provide is a way for us to create a new blog post and to get all of the blog post that exist you can extend this and you can make it more complicated but right now just with what we have once we add a URL for it it will automatically allow us to create and then return all of the different blog post objects that's what this generic AP I view does there are a ton of other generic API views you can look them up from the documentation and I'll show you one more after this now that we have the view though what we need to do is specify a root or a URL that allows us to access the view to do that we need to make a new file so we're going to make a file inside of our API app called urls.py now there's a two-step kind of routing system here what will happen is inside of my site in the urls.py file so I know it's a little bit difficult to see let's close that if you go into my site and urls.py you can see that we actually have the ability to forward URLs to different apps the way this works is we will always start by looking in this file and we'll look for a specific pattern and then we'll take the remainder after that pattern and forward it over to a different app in this case if we go to admin so we go to the URL of our server and then admin it's going to take whatever comes after the slash here and it's going to forward it over to the admin. site URLs to parse the rest of the request in our case what we want to do is we want to take any URL so anything that they type in and we want to forward that over to our API app the reason why we have this file here is you might have different apps and they may all have different prefixes and then have similar types of URLs you'll see what I mean in a second but for now we can actually remove the import from admin because we don't need that and we can change what's here to say path and just be an empty path and then we're going to write a function called include include and we're going to include the api. URLs and we're going to import the include function now what we're saying here is whenever we receive any type of URL it doesn't matter what it starts with what it ends with doesn't matter we're going to take it and we're simply going to pass it over to the api. URLs file where it will then be parsed from there keep in mind that if you wanted to you could do something like API slash and now if we want to access a URL that we write inside of our API app to get get there we would do something like the server URL slash API slash and then whatever the root is for our different views again I know it's a little bit confusing but you'll see what I mean when we write the URLs in our API so now we have the URLs being forwarded over to that app so let's just make this an empty string again let's go over to urls.py now and let's write these different URLs and connect them with the views that we just made the view is the root it's what's going to be rendered onto the screen or what will return data and the URL is how we get there so we're going to say from Django do URLs import path and we're going to say from dot import views the dot just means the current directory or the current package in this case so we're going to do that and import the views file where we will then be able to access the view that we wrote we're then simply going to say the URL patterns is equal to an array and inside of here we're going to make a new path and the path we're going to have is blog posts and then slash and make sure you have this trailing slash now what we're going to do is we're going to say views. the blog poost list create. asore View and we're simply going to give this a name and we're going to say this is the blog post view create view now I know it's a little bit long but let's zoom out here so you can read all of it what we're doing importing the path from the D Jango URLs we are importing the views and then what we're using is something known as a class-based view that's what we've created here this is a generic View and the way that we render it is we say views dot whatever the name of the class is do as view this pretty much means anytime we go to the blog post route here we're going to be brought to this page where we can then interact with the API now keep in mind we're going to do this from the browser but you can do this from postmen you can do this from a different server you don't have to do this graphically it's just nice to be able to view it graphically as we go through the tutorial so we were actually just about to run the server but before we do that there's actually one step that we need to do which is migrating our database now we'll talk about that step but first of all i' just like you to go into the models.py file and notice that we have this Auto add now it actually needs to be Auto now add I just had or I just found that story while I was looking at it so let's just fix that small mistake there that I had inside of the published date now what we're going to do is we're going to bring up the terminal and we're going to apply a database migration now anytime you create a new model or you make any changes to your models what you'll do is you'll make a new migration and you'll apply it and what that's going to do is use the D Jango om to automatically create the correct SQL tables or do whatever it needs to do essentially in the database for this to work properly so the way we do that is we make sure we're inside of our mysite directory and we type Python 3 manage.py and then we're going to say make migrations now make migrations is going to create the files that will specify what migrations need to be applied and this case you can see we're going to create a model blog post now we need to actually apply the migrations and to apply the migrations we simply type the command migrate so Python 3 manage.py make migrations wait for that to finish then Python 3 manage.py migrate when we do that we'll see that this is actually applied and we've now created the tables in our SQL database which is called db. SQL light 3 now we can clear and we can type the command Python manage.py and then run server and when we do that it will start running our python API so let's go ahead and do that we shouldn't get any errors here again make sure you fix this so it says Auto now add and you will see that we have this URL which is where our API is being ran so what we can do now is simply go to this in our browser so I'm going to control click it it's going to show me an error right away don't freak out the reason for this is because we need to go to the blog post URL so we're going to go slash blog post and we when we do that we'll see our API view now inside of here we can create a new blog post to do that we can do something like title and then test content and we can click on post and now you'll see a new blog post is created we have the option to call get when we call get it gives us an array that contains all of these now in this case we get a nice graphical view showing us how the API works but of course you can use this from something like Postman curl the command line doesn't matter you just need to call the API correctly with the correct headers and the correct field names in this case the field names will be title and and content those are the two required ones to create a new blog post okay so that is that route but I now want to shut down the server and I want to show you how we create some other roots that allow us to do some more specific things so first of all let's go into the views.py file and I want to mention that you may have noticed we didn't actually have the ability to delete any of the blog posts that we had now we can make it so that we can delete all of the blog posts in a single rout the way we can do that is by adding a root here to this API view because we can actually override the de default view sorry or we can actually create a new route that allows us to delete individual blog post so let's do that first and then I'll show you the override what I'm going to do is create a new class here and this is going to be the blog post and then the retrieve if I spelled that correctly update and Destroy view now inside of here this is going to be generics Dot and this is the retrieve destroy API view or actually sorry retrieve update destroy API view I know it's a little bit long so let's make this a bit easier to see and inside of here we're going to specify the same thing that we did before so we're going to copy the query set and the serializer class we're going to paste that inside of here and we're going to have the lookup field be equal to PK which stands for primary key which in this case is going to be the ID of our uh blog post now all this is doing is giving us another generic View this will allow us to access an individual um post and then we can update that post and delete that post so that's it for the view now what we'll do is we'll go over to our URLs and we'll make a URL to map to that view hopefully you're kind of getting the process by now so we're going to put a comma here we're going to make a new path and this path is going to be blog post slash and then in this case we're actually going to take a path parameter to do that we're going to say int colon and then this is going to be PK which stands for primary key we're going to have another slash then we're going to say views. the blog post and this is the retrieve update destroy View and we're going to say asore view like that and then we're going to give this a name and we can just say update I'm just giving it a short name for now because I don't want to write out the whole thing okay so what we've done here is specified hey we're going to have the same route with blog post but this time if you pass as a part of that path the ID of the object you want to retrieve what you can do is you can update delete it retrieve it that's it so now what we'll do is we'll go here and rerun our server we'll open it up again so let me bring it over here and if I go over to slash1 uh sorry slash blogpost SL one we'll see that we access the blog post with id1 which is the following one here so I could say test content update this and then put and then if I want I can delete this by click clicking on the delete button and now if we go back and we view all of the blog posts you'll see that we don't have any because we deleted them okay so that's almost all that I wanted to show you last thing I will quickly run you through run you through here sorry before we get into the deployment is how we override some of our views so if we go to views.py you'll notice that inside of here what we can actually do is override any HTTP method if we wanted to make this slightly more custom so in this case we're just using the generic views from Django because they're quite good and they're quite useful however we can override them so what I could do is I could say Define delete inside of here now for delete I need to take in self request star args and star star quars like that I then will say blogpost doobs doall and then I can say something like delete and then I can return a response which we're going to have to import in a second and we're going to say the status is equal to status. httpcore 204 noore content like that and now what we'll do is simply import from the rest framework uh actually yes from the rest framework we'll import status and then we'll say from the rest framework dot response import response and now what we've done is we've just ridden our own route and what this will do is add a delete route now to this API View and what will happen is it will just delete all of the different blog posts that exist and then return a response which is HTTP to a for no content which is what we're supposed to return when we delete something so just to quickly show that to you so you can see how easy this is and how it works now if I load up my server and I go to the page slash blog post okay you'll see that now a delete button exists and if we click that delete button it will actually just delete all of the blog posts that we have because that's the custom logic that we wrote here we just deleted all of the blog posts so to wrap up writing our views I'll show you creating a custom API view because this can be somewhat useful so I'm going to say from the rest framework. viws import the API View and I'm just going to paste in a view here that you can reference if you want to do this so let's say we want to make our own Roots where we don't want to use the generic ones well what we can do is inherit from the general API View and then what we can do is write different methods BAS Bas on the name of the method we want to implement so in this case get but we could write post delete put patch Etc and they'll automatically be added for us to whatever the root is that we write now in this case this is simulating getting all of the blog posts that have a matching title so what I've done is I've said okay well maybe I'm going to have a query parameter here called title what I'll do is check if the title exists if it does and I want to find any of the blog post that have that information contained in their title then if I don't have a title I'll get all of the blog posts I'll manually serialize them by using the blog post serializer which I can do using this and then I'll return a response that contains the data provided from the serializer with a status of HTTP 200 now if I wanted to connect this with the URLs same thing I would just have whatever the name of this is do as View and then that'd be it I just simply have written a simple API view here that allows me to query based on the name of a object all right so that's going to wrap up the coding phase of this video the next thing that I want to show you how to do is actually deploy this API so you can share it with other people and you can get it running on a public endpoint because currently we have this simply running on local host on our Port 8000 but instead we might want to run this on a public URL so it's a bit more flexible other people can use it and we can actually test it in a production environment so to do that bear with me I'm going to run you through the steps now for the deployment here we're going to use something known as acorn acorn is free you do not need to pay to use it and I have teamed up with them for this video now what Acorn allows us to do is create something known as an acorn file now this Acorn file will specify our entire application and pretty much describe how it should be deployed we can then use this Acorn file to build an acorn image somewhat similar to something like a Docker image we can then publish that image and we can use it to deploy as many instances of our application as we like now this is great because it allows us to actually deploy this out quite quickly but it also allows us to share our application with other people by giving them the acorn image you're going to see what I mean and I made an entire video about this if you want some more details so I'll link that here by putting it on the screen and leaving a link to it in the description now the first thing we need to do here is actually create a Docker file which specifies how we run our application and then the acorn file will specify all of the services and the additional configuration we need when we actually want to deploy this out so we're going to make a new file inside of my site called called Docker file now I'm going to paste in the contents of this file and you can copy it from the links in the description all of this code will be available on GitHub it just doesn't make sense for me to write all of this out because it's fairly long so let's quickly go through what this file actually looks like we start by specifying the Syntax for the docker file we specify the image we want to build this from then we have that we're exposing Port 8000 because that's where our server will be running we specify the working directory we install some system dependencies we copy the requirements.txt file which means we actually need to take this file and we need to put it inside of the my site directory so make sure it's inside of there we then use the PIP command to install all of the requirements we copy all of the contents of this directory we specify the entry point which is using Python 3 and then the command that we want to run to run our server which is Python 3 manage.py run server and then we just specify we want to run it on all the public endpoints so the docker file is pretty straightforward it's just explaining how we actually run the the application now the thing that we're missing though is all of the instructions for deploying the application we know how to run it when we want to deploy an app we need to do things like set up the database we may need to do some database migrations there's some other steps and that's where the acorn file comes in now before I write that Acorn file I'm just going to create a new file inside of my site and this is going to be db- script.sh and this is going to be a simple script that we're going to use whenever we start running our application so that we Mig the database and ensure that everything is set up so I'm just going to paste this in here again you can copy it from the link in the description we're running the Python 3 manage.py make migrations and then we're migrating just so that if we make any changes to the database that'll automatically be applied and when we do a new deployment the database that we're connecting to will have those tables created so this is a script that will run and I'll show you how we'll end up running that okay so now we have our Docker file we have our database script and we're going to go outside of this core directory here and we're going to make a new file file and we're going to call this the acorn file like this now for the acorn file to be a little bit more useful to us we're going to go into the extensions here in vs code and we're going to install the acorn extension it just gives us some syntax highlighting for this Acorn file so go ahead and do that and now I'm going to paste in the acorn file and quickly walk you through it now this can seem a little bit overwhelming but I promise you that if you read through the documentation it's not overly complex and there is all kinds of examples in the acorn docs for creating your own Acorn file this is just one for jeno okay so what are we doing here well inside of the acorn file we're essentially specifying everything we need to be able to deploy this application so we have some Services we have some jobs we have the containers that we need to run and we have the images that we're using so we start with some arguments and the one argument that we need is the Jango database name which is what we'll use when we actually create the database with whatever database server service sorry we choose to use so we're calling this D Jango DB we then have a service we're going to use now for our Django app we need to have a database this database can be many different types it could be postp it could be mongodb in this case we're going to use the Maria DB or Mariah DB whatever you want to call this what we do is just specify that for this database we are going to have the argument of Jango database name which is simply D Jango DB and we're using this image to essentially create a database for us so that's a service that's going to be a part of our deployed application we then have a job now what the job will do is initialize the database for us so we've called this dbit we're going to build images. app. container build which we specify down here so don't worry about that we have an environment inside of the environment we're using some environment variables or we're actually creating environment variables that come from this service so whenever we connect to a database well we need a username password address port and database name so we're just specifying what all of these are as accessible variable names that we can use within our code which we'll actually do in just a second we're consuming the database we have an entry point where we're using this script the bin bash and then the command that we want to run is this what this does is make our database script file executable and then it executes the database script file so we actually go and apply the migrations to our new database that we're connecting to we then have a container this is the container that runs our application the job is what runs beforehand to set everything up then what we do is we build the image that we specified down here which is inside of our Docker file this describes how to run the application we make sure we publish HTTP on Port 8000 we make sure we depend on this job so this job needs to finish before we start running this container and then we consume the database service that we specified up here we have some arguments for being in Dev mode like the directories that we're going to be using and then again we specify the variables that we need in our environment for this application to run properly down here we just specify the containers so where they're located essentially where the docker file is I know it seems seems a bit complicated but trust me if you've ever worked with Docker before or you start doing deployment you'll see how easy this is to actually write out okay so now that we have the acorn file there's a few last adjustments we need to make and then I'm going to show you how we run it so from my site we're going to go into requirements.txt and we're just going to add a package that we need when we start working with a mySQL database we're going to say MySQL clients like this which will allow us to work with the Mariah or Maria DB okay now that we have that what we're going to do is we're going to go into my site we're going to go to settings.py and we're going to make a few adjustments to allow this to actually be deployed because right now this is just for development on our local machine and we just need to adjust a few things so it works in a deployed environment so first of all we're going to go to alloud host and we're just going to add an exclamation or sorry an asterisk here which lets us run this on any host the reason we want that is so that we're able to run this on the acorn host which you're going to see in a second we're now going to make a variable here which is csrf uncore and this is going to be Trust trusted uncore Origins and this is going to store The Trusted Origins for when we submit our forms so we're going to have HTTP colon SL SL then this is going to be asteris uh do on- Acorn like that doio we're then going to copy this and we are going to paste it and just change this to https now we just need this so that when we're submitting the forms from the API site we don't get any csrf issues so we're just allowing all of the corn Origins because that's where we're deploying it to last thing we need to do is we need to import Os from the top here so we can access some environment variables and we're going to change our database configuration here so that we end up using the database that is created for us by the aord file for our deployment so what we'll do is we'll go down to databases and I'm just going to copy this in again you can copy it from the link in the description we're going to change default to be equal to this now what we've done is we've specified that that the engine we want to use is the back ends. MySQL engine this is different than the SQL light 3 engine we were using before we then want to connect to the Maria DB database so we have the name user password host and Port which all come from the environment variables which are specified inside of the acorn file so basic idea is Acorn file will spin up a database for us and then we want to make sure we use the environment variables that allow us to connect to that specific database so that's why we need to modify that inside of our python API or our Jango API okay that's all of the setup required now that we have that finished what we need to do is simply run the acorn file or run the acorn image or build the acorn image whatever you want to call it now in order to do that we first need to install the acorn CLI which is pretty straightforward let me get the command for you all right so I just have this page open which shows you how to install the acorn CLI you can go to docs. aorn doio install we can Brew install this if we're on Mac or Linux which is what I'm going to do so I'm going to copy that command or you can use scoop this is a tool that you need to install on Windows okay so I'm just going to go into my command prompt here and I'm going to paste in this command I already have Acorn installed so this should be fairly fast and for you guys it should install the acorn CLI now we simply run the command Acorn login when we do that it will log us into our Acorn account again you can just use GitHub to do this it's completely free and once we're logged in which I already am what we can do is run our Acorn file now to do do that we're going to CD into the root directory here so notice we have our Acorn file and then we have my site and now what we're going to do is simply type Acorn Dev and then dot now when I do that it's going to start running the acorn image for me and it will actually give us a deployed version of our app and then I'll show you how we can share this so let's hit enter we're going to give this a second to spin up you're going to see that it creates a database for us it gets a public URL it exposes the port just runs through everything which is really really nice and then we can access access the deployed URL which you'll see in a minute all right so you can see now that it actually ends up giving us an end point because this was deployed successfully so I can click on this open it up and now you'll see that we have our API and if I go here to SL blog posts we're able to view the API view but now this time it's on a publicly deployed https URL endpoint which could be quite useful especially in deployment now the way that I ran this is using something known as Dev mode Dev mode will give you some file synchronization and it just really quickly spins this up for you so you can start using it and you don't have to actually go to the acorn website however what I want to show you now is how you would actually share this with someone else so what you can do is simply create an acorn image you can publish that image and then you can just give someone the URL to that image and now they can create the same instance of your application pretty much instantly they can mess around with it they can break it they can change it and it doesn't affect your deployment because every time you deploy the acorn image you get a new deployment which is quite cool so let me show that to you and then we'll explain more about how it works all right so I just shut this down by hitting contrl C and now we're just going to run a command that allows us to actually kind of tag this image and upload it to a registry so other people can use it and you can share it now to do this we first need to log into a registry now the one most of us are familiar with is the docker one so that's what we're going to sign into we're going to say Acorn log and then index. docker.io now I'm already signed in but in your case just sign into to it and this allows you now to have a place where you can publish your different images there's a bunch of other registries as well uh but this is one that I'm sure most of you are probably going to want to use now what we're going to do is simply build the image so we're going to say Acorn build- T which stands for the tag name and then we're going to do the name of the registry which is index. docker.io slash this is going to be your username on the registry in this case mine is Tech with Tim Z and then you're going to give the name to your image so I'm going to say Jango tutorial YouTube like that okay I'm going to go ahead and run that it's going to build an acorn image for us once the acorn image is built we can then push it to the registry and we can really easily share it with other people all right so this has been built now that it's built what I want to do is push this so I'm just going to change the command so that rather than having Acorn build we simply say Acorn push and then it's just the same name of the image we just created when I do that it will push it to the registry and then we can simply take this name and we can create a URL that allows other people to deploy this image really really cool it's just like a Docker image except in this case it specifies the entire deployment of the application which makes it really easy to share and deploy without interfering with your actual code so you can see that this finished so I'm just going to copy the name of what it is that we deployed there or what we pushed sorry and now we can simply go to the acorn website so let me just load this up here so I just simply went to here and what I can do is click on my username I can click on shared acorns and then you can see that it shows me actually all the stats for different acorns that I have shared what I'm going to do is just paste in the image which is this and notice it gives me a link that I can share with people so now I can copy that link this will actually be what's in the description by the way and now you can simply paste that link into your browser when you do that it's going to bring you to the acorn platform it's going to show you the acorn image so we can view the source file of the acorn file we want we can pick where we want to deploy it to so what project or what folder we can just press on deploy and it's going to deploy a new instance for us so this is exactly what you guys will be able to do whatever you just saw pretty much in my terminal is going to happen exactly for you in your own Acorn account and you're going to get a running instance here that allows you to mess around with it now it's worth noting that these are not going to be deployed persistently they are going to be in kind of a container that will die after a few hours you can extend that time and you can still use Acorn to deploy persistently but it's a little bit of a different process and not something that I'm going to get into in this video all right so the acorn is finished provisioning here and you can see that it is running what I can do now is I can simply click on this button and it's going to bring me now to a URL this is different than the one that we have before where this is deployed now same thing I can go to SL blog post I now have a new instance of the API here that I can mess around with and do whatever I want with so there you go that's pretty much it for deploying with Acorn I think this is really cool especially because in a development environment it makes it really easy to share this with other people I now don't need to spin up a virtual private server I don't need to go do all this Linux config I just write a Docker file like I normally would I write an acorn file I now have the entire deployment of the application described I can just send this to my boss I can send this to a coworker and they can spin up their own version they can have it alive for as long as they want they can mess with it they can break it and it doesn't affect me and I don't have to constantly change things around or fix things that they're breaking anyways guys that's going to wrap up this video as a reminder all of this code will be available from the link in the description if you want to deploy your own version of this API you can click the acorn link that I have below and I look forward to seeing you in another [Music]

      "[Document(page_content=\"if you're new to programming I want you to listen to these next few minutes where I share with you a bit of wisdom from someone who's been learning and teaching coding for nearly 10 years and that person is me and I want to begin by saying coding is hard this is a tough thing to do it's not going to be easy and in fact it's probably going to be one of the hardest things you've ever done but that's more of a reason why you should actually do it and I just want to give you some kind of tips and advice in this video to really keep you pushing and make sure you remember why you wanted to learn to code in the first place and you don't give up on that goal so first off coding again very difficult very frustrating I am a relatively calm person I'm usually fairly stoic but when I run into bugs when I can't solve something for the 30th minute or for the fifth hour it's been 2 days and I just can't get past an issue you will see me punching my monitor screaming yelling doing push-ups to get my energy out like it just goes crazy it's such a frustrating thing and there's nothing in my life I've done that's more frustrating than trying to solve some of the simplest coding bugs this is something that even at the higher levels of development you're going to experience and sometimes it makes you question your life decisions why you're doing this and what even is the point of building this website or this project or whatever is going on now I have obviously gotten better at dealing with that over the years but I just want to make you aware that it's a very very normal feeling and I've had many nights where I've gone to bed with an unsolved bug and ask myself what the heck I'm doing and if I should just change career paths and go do something else because I don't want to deal with this so very normal feeling and you will learn how to overcome that and in fact that's one of the most impactful things being able to persevere being able to solve that impossible bug to work through that tutorial to set up your computer when it's been hours and hours and it's nothing is working is really one of the most satisfying feelings in the world and I can tell you that I still remember bug fixes I did when I was 17 years old because of how long they took me and how ecstatic and elated I felt that I was actually finally able to to solve them so please keep going don't give up that ability to persevere is something that carries much further than just coding and it really brings itself into your everyday life I can say since I've gotten better at programming and as I've gone through this journey I just feel more confident I think any problem I have is solvable that I can fix it that I can figure it out and that's one of the most freeing things in the world obviously you can get this from doing other things not just learning how to code but I think that being a developer you really learn that quite quickly any problem is fixable it is solvable there is a solution you can figure it out and I want you to remember that because there is always a way to fix a problem it's not impossible and it comes down to how much can you persevere and how much more effort can you give how much more time can you put into it and can you use strategies to help you calm down relax and approach the problem from a different angle now with that said I want to talk a little bit about the coding journey I remind you that this is exactly what it says a journey and it's Unique for everyone it's really discouraging when you're just learning how to code and you go online and you see stories of people that learned to code in 3 months and got a job at Google or ran the next AI Tech startup and made a billion dollars or our you know y combinator Founders at 19 years old and our AI Geniuses and programming experts that is an abnomaly and is really really dangerous and toxic to compare yourself to those type of people even comparing yourself to someone like myself a YouTuber who's been doing this for a very long time or going on Reddit forum are looking at people that just have all these great success stories at such a young age or in such a short time period this is really not a healthy thing to do and I want to discourage you from doing that now yes it can be motivating and you can take that component of it but the reality is everyone learns us at a completely different pace I've taught over 10,000 people how to code on a more personal level I know their stories and I know that all these people had a completely different Journey needed different resources different videos a much different time frame some people yet yes they can do it in a few months other people it takes years the amount of time it takes you to learn this does not dictate your ability to code and it does not say if you're a good or bad developer some of the best developers I know it took them a really really long time to get started and I was one of those people it took me years to really get my confidence in programming many people wouldn't know that watching my videos but that's the case a lot of time a lot of effort and I promise you it is worth it so just a friendly reminder here don't compare yourself to other people you want to make sure you're just looking at your own progress obviously you want to move forward you want to make progress but don't go look at those brainiacs online that are getting jobs at 19 and 20 years old and making hundreds of thousands of dollars those are abnomalities that is not normal it is going to take you a long time to do this and everyone's journey is completely different you really need to embrace that and remember that it's about you it's not about all the other people now with all that said I want to leave you with one last parting message here programming and software development is one of the highest value skills you can build in 2024 and that's because it gives you time location and Financial Freedom this gives you the skill to choose where you want to work who you want to work for how much money you want to get paid you can do this in any location you can do this in any time zone and you can do it for any company at any rate or any salary you want now obviously you got to build yourself up it's not like you can just demand to get paid half a million dollars a year but the reality is there's very few skill sets that give you all of those traits like software development does and over the past few years I've taken advantage of those I've been traveling a lot more now I'm actually moving to Dubai very shortly kind of a little announcement there and it's one of the things that I really appreciate about this skill set I can do it anywhere I want I can do it on any time zone and I can pretty much control my income by doing different jobs freelance gigs teaching programming or even building my own company if I wanted to go ahead and do that so I highly encourage you learn this skill if you do want a premium option to do that I do have a software development course this is with course careers we run you through software development fundamentals teach you in specialization in front end backend or devops and then help you every step of the way to actually Landing your first job check that out from the link in the

      "[Document(page_content=\"I've made over 200 python projects and today I'm going to share with you my favorites now I've got five projects to demo for you here and the best part is none of these are super complicated which means you could code them out in just a few days if you've got some experience with python now I hope you take this video's inspiration and make sure you stick around into the last project because I do have a surprise I want to share with you but first let me tell you about a way that you can code these projects out faster and that's by using bubble the sponsor of this video and the world's first full stack no code production grade platform bubble is programming anything that can be built with code can be built faster using bubble with bubble you have everything you need to build real world apps from design data and logic this means you can rapidly build visually captivating robust and responsive apps while integrating with databases and functionality like user authentication checkout experiences and social networking features if you don't believe me you can check out these full guides that walk you through building entire apps like an Instagram clone an nft Marketplace a budgeting app a udemy clone and tons of others you can start building your first app in a matter of minutes by working through one of these projects or by checking out these interactive lessons who knows maybe you'll even end up building an entire company going from prototype to IPO to a successful business like tons of others already have using bubble bubble supports everyone from Individual developers to Fortune 500 companies and you can get started with them today by clicking the link in the description so let's get into into the demo and I want to remind you that the projects I'm showing you here are my favorite ones the ones I had the most fun building that I can remember today not necessarily the most impressive ones the ones I would put on something like a resume these projects were really what got me into coding and got me really excited and passionate and that's why I'm sharing them with you here so the first one that I have is called super mini golf and this was my grade 12 final project in my computer science class now the idea here was we had to make some kind of game in Python using pame which to to date is still my favorite module that I just love making games in so I made a game that I used to play on my phone all the time which was Super Stickman Golf so I pretty much just remade this in P game you can see that there's like sand traps there's water hazards you can uh shoot the ball that was a gray one there there's some powerups that I'll show you this was a really hard game for me to make back when I was how old would I've been here 17 18 years old it took me a really long time but it was one of the most fun times I've ever had and I've shown this project to so many people and it was something that I was really really proud of uh back in the day all right so I've just wrapped up the game here you can see it didn't go so well after the first few holes that I was actually recording uh but you guys get the idea here and I also implemented like a little ball shop thing where you could purchase different colored balls and equip them pretty cool so anyways that's first game or first project let's go to the next one so the next project is online multiplayer chess and this this is something I made during an 18-hour coding live stream on this channel this is really what brought my channel to the next level it's what got me a bunch of views a bunch of you found me because of this game and it's what really pushed me to keep making YouTube videos and coding so this is one of my favorite projects of all time it is far from polish and if I was going to remake it today it would be significantly better but I still love it and I want to show it to you guys so it's online chess game pretty straightforward you can join with two different clients ignore the fonts all being off but that's just how it was uh one person is white one person is black and when you make a move it will adjust on the other person you can see we have 50 minute timers going by default so on white here I can make my move then we give it a second and we'll see the move updates on the other board you can see the server on the bottom leftand corner here so here let's make our move on BL okay you see it updates there maybe we could play the English opening and I'll just get to a stage where we can like capture a piece so we can check that that is indeed working okay so let's go here fun fact this is the opening I usually play and then let's just test this out and make sure the piece capture does actually work you can see it does we can capture back and even rules like castling all that kind of stuff is implemented in here and yeah it's quite fun at one point I actually ran a live stream where I had you guys all play this game and I actually hosted the server like in like a real virtual private server so you guys could all connect I don't know how well that worked when I'm thinking back to it I think there was quite a few bugs but it was cool to see you guys actually on there playing my game and yeah this is one of the first online things I made it was really really fun and now let's move on to the next project so the next project I have for you here is a sodoku solver now the first reason I remember this project so much is because I put it on my YouTube channel and so many of you guys made fun of the way that I say that word I still don't know what the correct pronunciation is if I'm saying it right if you guys are wrong so you can let me know in the comments but the idea is you can just play a normal game of soku here so what I can do is try to pencil in a number so let's say I think one goes here I can go ahead and hit enter and if it doesn't conflict with anything it will let me actually put that in now if I try to put another one here you see that I actually gives me an X and tells me hey that's wrong you can't actually put that number there and then let's say I go through maybe I pencil in a few different numbers I think you know three or four goes here five seven whatever like a normal game and then at some point I say you know what I don't want to solve this anymore let's have the computer do it and I can go ahead and hit the space bar and it will automatically solve the board for me now it does this using a backtracking algorithm it's really interesting how that works and I had a lot of fun building up this project because it was super visual it actually shows you exactly what's going on and how the computer is solving this board and I just found it really fun and it was something that again taught me quite a bit about algorithms wanted to share it with you here if you want to check it out I'll leave the code link to it in the description so moving on to the next project this one is definitely the most practical but it requires a little bit of context to understand it so a long time ago I used to work at a summer camp this was a sports camp and we had a bunch of different groups so maybe we'd have 200 300 kids and they'd be split into seven eight groups Etc something along those lines okay now each of those groups would go throughout the day and at set kind of time periods just like school they would go and play some kind of activities they might do soccer they might do lacrosse football it was a sports camp so all the different groups went and eventually throughout the week they'd want to play you know every single one of the different activities that existed and sometimes they'd play it two times three times Etc the problem is that no two groups can be playing the same thing at the same time because of equipment constraints Etc so we had some office staff at the camp where every week they would have to go and create a schedule that looks something like this for every single one of the groups depending on how many there were they have to fill in all the different activities and they need to make sure there's no conflicts so that there's not one group playing you know tennis well another one's supposed to be playing tennis then they have to do things like move around the lunches move around when they're swimming there's just all these different things that uh are happening pretty much and it's very difficult to create these schedules because of the number of constraints so what I did for them is I kind of asked them let me just delete this here to explain to me how this system worked and then I wrote out a program that actually went and generated these schedules for them so this is what the UI of the program looked like it's super basic but the idea is you can go in and you can select what period the lunch and the swim is going to be for all of the different groups and then you put in the number of groups and then any of the activities now some weeks maybe soccer is not available or basketball's not available or whatever so you deselect those right and then you can choose what week you want to generate it for so maybe this is week two and I can put in something like six groups hit generate schedule and then what it will do is automatically generate a schedule that has no uh conflictions that they can then go review edit modify and use now this saved them literally hours of work every single week because before they literally had like sticky notes out pretty much and they had like eight different sheets which were the mock schedules and they'd go around and they were like he does group two have this does group three have this and they were manually doing what I wrote this code to do in just a few seconds so you can see that when I click that it generates a new schedule here now I'm on windows so it looks a little bit funky when I open it up but if I click here we have the week 2 schedules and then it gives us a schedule where it's kind of filled in all of the different activities uh and yeah it just made it so that now they don't have to do that and obviously they can go and modify this but it saved them a ton of time they loved it I loved creating it cuz it was actually a really useful project and the way I did this was actually using backtracking as well it's kind of a fancy algorithm where you can go and you can just check all of the different possible schedules you could create based on a set of constraints and I actually made this using something called Pi qt5 uh which is a UI library in Python which is pretty basic which lets you set up something like this right where we have like all these input boxes check Boxes Etc so yeah that's pretty much it for project 4 but wanted to share with you because this is a real useful project something that you guys might be able to come up with based on different use cases you have and actually saved a ton of time and with some pretty valuable software so we move on to project number five but first I do want to share with you that surprise that I promised now that is that I recently started a completely free school Community this is a place where you can network with other programmers you can talk with me we have some free courses in there that you can watch there's a bunch of valuable information completely free no strings attached you can join from the link in the description and that's the surprise that I wanted to share with you now that leads me into project number five which is a tower defense game built in Python now unfortunately I don't still have access to the source code for that project but I'll run some videos on this screen so you guys can see what it looked like now I coded this out during a 12-hour coding live stream on my channel it was a lot of fun to make I personally Love Games as you guys can probably tell from this video I used to always play Tower Defense games like balloon Power Defense 3 4 5 Etc so I wanted to make something like that in code in Python so that's what I did we had different enemies we had bosses we had different Health we had towers that you could upgrade that you could change the radius for we had like assisted Towers I had this whole UI library with different assets that looked really really cool there was some funky music in the background and I just had a lot of fun coding this project out it was also sufficiently difficult and it was fun to kind of problem solve and figure out okay how are we going to move the enemies how the towers going to look like they're animated and not attacking each other and there's a lot of fun challenges and just a really cool project to make so that guys is going to wrap up this video I know a lot of these projects are pretty simple but I just wanted to share with you five really fun projects that personally were my favorite now as I said these are not the best projects I've ever made they're not necessarily ones I would put on my resume but I just really enjoyed them they're ones that I did purely because I wanted to do them and not because I was trying to grind some project or learn data structures and algorithms they were just fun they were useful and that's what really got my passion going in coding and I want to encourage you to do the same thing so let me know the projects that you guys are working on in the comments down below make sure you join that free school community and I will see you in another YouTube [Music] video\", metadata={'source': 'y_1-hOBcLas',

      "Channel: Tech With Tim\n",
      "\n",
      "[Document(page_content=\"in this video I'll be showing you how to build a full stack application using both Python and JavaScript the idea here is to demonstrate how we design a larger piece of software that has both a front end and a back end now for the back end we'll use Python and flask and we'll build out an API we'll also connect that with the database and then for the front end we'll use react and JavaScript you don't need to be an expert in either of these Frameworks or languages but you should have some experience with both Python and JavaScript to make this a little bit easier to follow along with the main goal is to teach you how you design this system overall we're not going to make anything super complicated but you're going to see how we separate the responsibilities and the roles and you get a better sense of how these larger systems work and how we do interactions between two different software components this is going to be a really interesting video and this is really what's going to bring you from that beginner or intermediate level up to the point where you have some more comfortability building your own apps and designing different system systems and components so we'll get into the content but I do want to share with you that I am running a giveaway right now that will give you a chance to win an RTX 480 or some DLI credits courtesy of Nvidia now I've partnered with them for this video to promote the GTC this is the global technology conference it happens every year this year is happening from March 17th to 21st in San Jose California now there is actually an in-person event you can pay for tickets to enter that one or there is a completely free virtual component where you can can register for all kinds of great events workshops live sessions Etc and really learn about what's going on in the state of AI just to quickly give you a rundown we've got sessions on generative AI we have stuff for creators we have computer vision related sessions and then three sessions that I'm personally interested in are the following large scale production deployment of rag pipelines so talking about retrieval augmented generation and llms this has been a big interest of mine recently I've posted a bunch of videos on the channel they've also got a session on the future of extended reality and generative Ai and then one I think a lot of you guys will like which is exploring AI assisted developer tools really cool sessions I'll link them down below and if you're wondering how to enter the giveaway all you have to do is attend the GTC the virtual component of it is completely free and then I'll link a Google form in the description all you have to do is put in your email country of residence Etc so we know where to ship the GPU to if you win and then just attach a screenshot of you attending the GTC anyways that's it thanks to Nvidia for running this giveaway good luck to any of you if you do decide to attend the GTC just make sure you fill out this form so you can be entered in the giveaway and with that said let's get into the video okay so I'm on the computer now and I want to give you a quick demo of what it is that we're going to be building now keep in mind that this is a relatively simple application however the type of things that we're going to do here will really show you how you architect out a front end and a back end how they communicate with each other and that's really where the real value is it's not necessarily in the project obviously I could have made this a lot better but the idea is I want to give you a template I want to teach you the base and then allow you to extend this and go build your own applications rather than you guys watching me say style a web page for 3 or 4 hours that's not going to give you the same value then it will be for me to actually show you all of the backend architecting how you design this how you set up the different endpoints how an API works that's what you're going to learn in this video so keep that in mind even though I know the finished project is a little bit boring regardless this is a contact list this uses a persistent database so if I refresh you can see everything is still here we have the ability to update delete create and fetch or to get the different entries so this is kind of a crud create read update delete application you can see here that I could go and maybe change the email to say Tim 2@gmail.com when I do that you'll actually see a corresponding request get sent to my back end which is running in the background if I want to create a new contact I can do that maybe Sarah I don't know let's go Jose I know that doesn't really make sense but we'll do it at gmail.com create new contact and if we want we can delete one of the contacts and as I showed you we can update so that's about it this front end is built in react it's pretty straightforward you can style it after if you want and it allows us to interact with the back end which is ritten in Python with flask so with all that said let me open up a new folder here and let's get started building out this application all right so I'm inside of Visual Studio code and we're going to go ahead and get started here now I've opened up a new folder called tutorial and I want to mention that if at any point in time you're getting stuck all of the code that I write in this video will be available from the link in the description now at this point I'm going to assume that you've installed both Python and node.js and you have worked with react and python before you don't need to be an expert if you're still beginner with those libraries it's fine but you should have seen them before used them a little bit because this isn't going to be a completely from scratch beginner tutorial I'm assuming that you're kind of more at that intermediate level feel free to follow along regardless but just want to mention that so that you don't get super intimidated as I go through now what we're going to do here inside this new folder I've opened in vs code is we're going to make a folder called backend now that we have back end that's where our backend and our python app is going to live and in our terminal we're going to create a new uh react application now as of 2024 the command to do this has changed I'm going to paste in the command because it's a little bit long this is npm create V Vite whatever you want to say at latest and then you're going to give the app a name in this case we're going to call it front end and then two dashes then-- template react okay so go ahead and hit enter with this command and this should make a new folder for us you can see that we have the front end folder now it gives us some commands to actually run the front end so we can CD into front end and then we can type npm install to install the necessary packages so let's go ahead and do that okay so while that runs let's quickly talk about the order we're going to go in here we're going to start by building the back end now typically when you're building an application like this you want to build the API or the backend first and what this acts as is kind of the structure of the application and really the different operations that you can perform so in our case we're going to be creating a crud backend now this stands for create read update delete so we want to implement these four main operations in our case it's going to be on one instance or one object which is kind of a contact right we're creating a contact we're updating a contact we're deleting a contact or we are fetching or getting the different context now that's really all that we're doing here uh with the back end and what that involves is setting up some different Roots so some things that can be called now these roots or these end points can be called from really any type of application it doesn't have to be a react front end it could be any front end it could be another backend the idea is we create this protocol or this application programming interface that now defines the set of operations that our application has and then we can go Implement a nice front end we can build it in an app we can do really anything we want to call these different methods you'll see what I mean as we go through here but that's kind of the high level overview that you should understand at this point okay so now we're going to change directories and we're going to go into our backend directory so we go into the root directory and then CD into backend and we're going to install a few different python modules that we're going to need for this tutorial now the python modules we're going to need are the following we're going to say pip 3 install and then flask now if you're on Windows it's probably going to be pip rather than pip three so this is going to install flask for us so let's go ahead and hit enter you can see I've already got that installed as well as flask we're going to need flask and then Dash SQL and then Alchemy now this is something known as an OM which is an object relational mapping which allows us to connect to a SQL database and kind of map the entries in SQL into a python object so we can operate on our objects quite a bit easier so we're going to pip install flask SQL Alchemy I already have that installed so I'm not going to install it and then we also going to install flask Das cores notice the capitalization is different here and this is going to allow us to have cross origin requests which we'll talk about when we get to that point so again you want flask flask SQL Alchemy and then flask course okay so install all of those and for your pip command that should be working if not you can also try python hyphen M pip install and always if you're on Mac or Linux it's going to be Python 3 whereas on Windows it's going to be python which makes my job a little bit harder to explain but hopefully you guys know the difference in those commands Okay so now that we have that we're going to go into backend and we're going to create a few files we're going to have main.py we're going to have models. pi and we're going to have config if we can spell this correctly dop okay now config config sorry is going to contain the main configuration of our application I like to separate this out in a separate file so it's nice and easy to see and to find main is going to contain our main roots or the main end points if we had a really large app we might separate this into multiple files but in our case it's pretty straight forward and the models is going to contain all of our database models so pretty much how we interact with the database when we use flask SQL Alchemy what we do is we create a python class which represents kind of an entry or a row in our database kind of like a table and we Define the different columns and data that this object will be storing okay so that's it for these files first thing we're going to do is we're going to go into config and we're going to configure our application remember we're building the API first which happens in flask so we're going to say from flask import flask with a capital f we're going to say say from flask underscore if we could spell this correctly and this is going to be SQL Alchemy import and then SQL Alchemy we're then going to say from flask cores Import in all capitals cores now this stands for cross origin request and what this allows us to do is send a request to this back end from a different URL Now by default uh when you send requests they're going to be kind of protected so that our server can't be hit from a different URL that might be a little bit confusing for you but in our case we have a front end which is a different server than the back end we want the front end to be able to communicate with the back end in order for that to work we're going to have to remove this kind of Coors error which can pop up so that's what this cores uh modules doing if you've never seen the error before it's going to be confusing if you have you'll know exactly what I mean okay so we're going to say app is equal to flask and then we're going to say underscore uncore name underscore uncore okay this initializes the flask application now that we have this we're going to have a few more things of configuration so we're going to wrap our app in course so just going to say cores and then app like this all that does is it's going to essentially disable that error for us so now we'll be able to actually send cross origin requests to our app next thing we need to do is initialize some database things so we're going to say app. config and then inside of set of square brackets we're going to say SQL Alchemy in all capitals uncore database URI is equal to and then this is going to be sqlite and then Colony database. DB what we're doing here is specifying the location of the local sqlite database that we're going to be storing on our machine so all we're doing is we're just storing essentially a file which is going to be a SQL light database this is really easy to work with in flask so we need to specify okay well where do we want to save it or what is the name of it so you always start that with SQL light colon SL slash and actually there's going to be three slashes my bad not two and then the name of your database which is my database. DB you can name this anything that you would like okay next we're going to say app. config and this is going to be SQL Alchemy assuming I spelled that correctly I think I did underscore track underscore modifications and for now we're going to make this equal to false now all this does is mean we're not going to track all of the modifications we make to the database uh you may want to enable that but for our development purposes it's just going to make our life a little bit easier so we're going to disable it last thing we're going to do here is we're going to create an instance of the database we're going to say TB is equal to SQL Alchemy and then we're going to pass our app now what this is going to do is create a database instance which gives us access to the database that we specified here so we can create modify delete Etc and you're going to see how easy it is to do that using this database object from flask SQL Alchemy again what this acts as is an orm object relational mapping meaning we can have a python class that just normal python code and and using normal python code sorry we can modify this SQL database because pretty much any command we perform will be kind of translated for us automatically into SQL and then apply to the database making our life really really easy easy okay so that is config.py next thing we're going to do is we're going to start defining our database models now notice the order that I'm going in here right I start with my configuration then I'm going to go to my database the reason I do this is I want to know the different piece of data that I'm going to be working with so that when I start writing my code I already have that out of the way so I start with my basic configuration okay this happens first that makes sense next we do our database models and now we'll know what kind of field we need how we're going to be adding them how we're deleting them different keys that we might want to check so always kind of start with the data first and then once you know the different data you're going to have you can start creating different views that will allow you to create that data or modify that data which is really what the API is going to be responsible for doing so what we're going to do here is we're going to say from config import DB now this is a uh relative import and this is happening from this config file so we're saying okay we have this config python file it's got this DB um variable we're going to import that because this is the instance which is going to give us access to SQL Alchemy now we're going to create a class and this class is going to be called Contact and it's going toer inherit sorry from db. model so what we're saying is this is going to be a database model represented as a python class and now in Python code we can Define the different fields that this object will have so first we're going to have an ID you always need to have an ID for all of your database instances so we're going to say idid is equal to db. column and inside of here we're going to specify the type of the field which is going to be an integer next we're going to say the primary undor key is equal to true and what this means is that this is the key we're going to use to Index this and it must be unique for every single entry inside of the database we're then going to specify the other things that we want to store for a contact now for a contact we're going to have a first name a last name and an email that's it we could add a lot more later if we want I just want to keep it nice and simple so I'm going to say db. column and then here we're going to say that this is db. string and whenever you specify a string column you have to give it a maximum length so in this case we'll give it a maximum length of 80 we're then going to say unique is equal to false and nullable is equal to false now what that means is that you cannot pass a null value so let me just make this a little bit easier to read here so if you try to make the um first name null you're going to get an error so you have to pass something for first name that's all knowable does now we're going to copy this twice and paste it down here for this one we're going to change it to last name and it's going to stay exactly the same because we just want the same field but for the last name then we're going to have an email so we're going to say email is equal to this and what we'll do is make the email unique so that no two contacts can have the same email and then what we're going to do is just make this a little bit longer and we'll say okay the maximum length for an email we'll make it 120 characters okay so that's about it the next thing we're going to do is Define a function here called 2or Json and this is going to be something that can take all of the different fields that we have on our object here and convert it into a python dictionary which we can then convert into Json which is something we can pass from our API so when we build an API typically the way we communicate is we use something known as Json Json is a JavaScript object notation and it really just looks like a python dictionary so what we'll be doing is we'll be passing Json back and forth so the API will return Json and then we will send Json to the API for creating our different objects so what I want to do is say okay I've got all these different fields that I'm storing in my contact but now I want to make it so that I can convert them all into this Jon object so it's really easy for me to take a contact and give that to the front end or to anyone who's requesting to get our different context so what we're going to do is say return we're going to return a python dictionary and we're going to say ID is equal to self. ID we're going to say first name like this is equal to self. first name we're going to say last name is equal to self. last name and then email is equal to self. email now quick pause here you'll notice that what I did is I pretty much just wrote the same field names except in camel case without any spaces or anything and then Associated it with their value now the reason I'm using camel case here is because when we use Json the convention is to have camel case Fields so camel case is just like the word and then you have a capital letter on the next word whereas snake case which is what we're using here is the convention for python so it gets a little bit confusing but when we're writing python code so a variable like this we do it in snake case when we're working with Json or when we're going to be kind of returning value from our API we want to do this in camel case so that it matches the convention of Json data it's kind of just a style thing it doesn't really matter how you do it but I just wanted to mention uh why we have that all right so that's it for our data so we have our data and we have our configuration and now we're going to go into Main and we're going to start writing different roots that we need now before I start writing anything I like to kind of figure out what are the different endpoints or rootes that I want for my API to access different data resources to create resources Etc now in our case we want a crud app which is create read update delete so we need an operation for creating for reading or getting for updating and for deleting so we can kind of write those out in some comments right we can start by saying okay well we want to create and then we have to specify when we create what do we need well to in order to create a contact we need our first name right we need our last name and we need our email so what that tells me is that when I submit a request and I'll talk about this request and response structure in just a second to the create endpoint I need to pass these different values now let's quickly talk about this because I want to make sure I'm not confusing a lot of you with end points so when we create an API what we typically have is a server that's running the API now the server has some kind of address in our case the address is going to be something like Local Host colon 5000 because we're running this on our local machine now this is the domain or the servers URL if we're talking about other like websites you've gone to something like google.com right that is the domain or the URL now an endpoint is simply anything that comes after this domain so if I have Local Host col 5000 slome the endpoint is home right so we're going to the home endpoint so in our case we're going to have a create endpoint right we'll probably call it something like create contact now what I'm saying is when we hit this endpoint or when we submit a request to the endpoint we're we going to have to submit some data alongside just the endpoints we're saying okay yes we're going to go to this endpoint but we want to create the contact what do we need for that we need the first name last name and we need the email now let's quickly talk about request and response a request is anything that we send to some kind of server in our case an API now what we're doing is we're requesting something to happen and our request has a type now this type can be one of many different things but the typical ones are going to be the following the first type that's very common is a get request now a get request means that we're trying to access some type of resource so it just means we want to get something we want to retrieve something another type of request we have is a post request a post request means we're trying to create something new so in the case where we are using create contacts when we send a request here the type of our request is going to be a post request because we want to create a new contact now we also have a put or a patch request now this is something that you use when you want to update something so I want to maybe update a contact so I'm patching it I'm changing it we then have a delete request and we have a bunch of other requests as well that you can use but these are the four most common ones now as well as the type we also have some other data that we can send and one of this piece of data can be Json data now Json data is exactly what I kind of wrote out before and it's information that can comes alongside our request that's going to be used while we're handling the request to do something so in this case we want to delete a contact well we need to pass the type of contact we want to delete or what contact it is right in the case where we want to create a contact we need to pass the data to create the contact so that is the really Basics on a request we send a request in our case the front end is going to send a request to our back end and the back end is going to return a response now a response will contain a few things it's going to contain a stat stat and the status specifies if the request was successful so a status of 200 means success and you may have seen a status like 44 before and that means not found right so when you see those 404 pages that means hey you went to a URL you tried to receive some HTML to be rendered on your screen but it wasn't found so what did you get you got a status of 404 you know request not found right we were not able to do this because what you requested didn't exist we also have things like 400 which is bad request we have stuff like 403 I believe which is forbidden or unauthorized there's all different types of response statuses or codes that we can use to indicate what happened we also can return some Json so in the case where we maybe want to get a contact then when we have a response we're going to be responding with a Json which is equal to whatever that contact is hopefully this is making a little bit of sense but the idea is we have these different endpoints right they're just code written in Python they can handle a request which will come from some external Source in our case the front end or a website and then our API is going to return a response which contains how that request was handled it's going to say yes this was successful here's the result you're looking for or no there was some kind of error so that's what we're building here we're building this API and this structure so let's get started doing that and I promise it'll start to make a bit more sense so I'm going to say from flask import request and Json ify now what jsonify will do is allow us to return Json data which you've kind of already seen we're then going to say from config import the app and import our database and we're going to say from Models import the contact model so from config we're importing the app and we're importing our database from Models we're importing contact and then from flask we just need this request object and we need jsonify okay now first thing we need to do is we need to run our flask application so we're going to say if the name is equal toore maincore underscore keep in mind these are two underscores here then what we're going to do is say app. run and then debug equals true now what this checks is if we're running this file directly so it means hey if you actually ran main.py then execute the code that's inside of here this essentially avoids us running this code if we were to maybe import something from this file instead because in Python when you import something from a file it's going to execute all of the code in that file but when we have this line it kind of protects us from that which means hey if we import this file don't do this but if we run the file directly do this now another thing we need to add here is we need to instantize our database now I know I butchered that word but you get the idea so we're going to say with app.app uncore context db. create all now what this does is say okay right when we start the application or we're about to start the application we're going to get the context of our application don't worry too much about this code I'm not going to explain in depth how it works then we have db. create all now what this says is go ahead and create all of the different models that we have defined in our database Now it only does this if they're not already created but the idea is we need to actually spin up the database if it doesn't already exist so that's what this code is doing here it's saying okay do we already have the database well if we don't we got to create it so let's go ahead and do that then we start running the code and that will run all of our different endpoints and our API okay so let's begin by just writing the um get method okay so the first thing we'll want to do right is like get some context so how do we get these different contexts and I want to show you how that works so we're start by saying at app. root and then inside a set of parentheses here we specify the root or the end point that we're going to go to so I'm going to say slash context then beside this we're going to say methods equal to a list and we're going to specify the valid method types okay before I go any further let me explain this this here is something known as a decorator now this goes above a function which we're going to write in a second you don't need to know exactly how it works but you just know the name decorator inside of here right CU we're saying okay we're creating a new route we specify what route we're going to go to in this case B it's SL contacts and then we specify the valid methods and remember I was telling you we have methods like post delete patch Etc but those are only valid for certain URLs in our case we only want to be able to use the get method for this URL so that's what we're doing now beneath here we're going to write a function so we're going to say Def and then getor context you can call this function anything you want so long as it's Unique and then inside of here we can actually specify how we want to handle a get request that is sent to the route so what I'm going to do is say contacts is equal to contact. query and then doall now what this does is it uses flask SQL Alchemy which is our om to get all of the different context that exists inside of the contact database that's all it's doing it's just getting all of the different contacts and I told you it's super easy to do that so it gives us a list of all the different contacts the issue is these contacts are python objects right like they look like this they're python object that have the fields ID first name last name email now we can't return python objects from our code what we can return instead is Json data so what we need to do is take all these python objects and we need to convert them into Json now that's why we wrote this two Json method here that we're going to use from main.py so I'm going to do a little bit of fancy python here but what we're going to do is say Json _ contacts are equal to and I'm going to use this map function now in the map function I'm going to pass a function which is Lambda I'm going to talk about this in a second I'm going to say Lambda X and then x. 2or Json and then I'm going to pass my contacts okay what is this doing well our contacts is a list of contact objects we know that all of these contact objects have the 2 Json method so what we need to do is call them call that method sorry for all the different contacts and then create a new list that just contains the uh Json for the contact so what map does is it takes all the elements from this list and applies a function to them and gives us the result in a new list now the function we're using here is just known as a Lambda function it's just a shortcut for writing a function in one line you say Lambda you specify a variable in this case it's the parameter and then you can use that parameter and call anything you want so in this case X is always going to be of the contacts from our list we're going to call to Json on that contact and then it's going to put it inside of a new list the only thing is this map actually returns a new map object what we want instead is a list so we're just going to convert this to a list nice and easily like that okay now what we're going to do is we're going to say return and we're going to say jsonify and we're simply going to return a Json object that says context and that is equal to Json context what we're doing so saying okay we have this context key in our python dictionary it's going to be associated with the Json context which is what we just created here which is a list of all the contacts we have this python uh dictionary object we convert it into Json data using this jsonify function and that's it that's all we have to do so now if we run our code I'll show you how this works so I'm going to clear I'm going to type Python 3 main.py now if you're on Windows it's just going to be python notice that it's going to start running our server so let's bring this up here it says this is a development server blah blah blah and then it gives us the URL so we can copy the URL here which just Local Host Port 5000 and if we open up a new browser window so let's open up one here let me just make this a new tab so it's a little bit easier to see okay you can see that I pasted the URL in here and now I'm going to go to slash contacts because contacts is the get URL and I'm going to hit enter and notice that we get this response it says contacts and it's an empty list so what we did when we use the browser here by default is we send a get request to any URL that we put here so we put the URL of our server we put the endpoint which is/ contacts and then it gave us this Json reply which is contacts well we don't have any of those yet okay there you go that is how it works for actually getting the context so now we can shut the server down if we want by hitting contrl + C we don't have to it will actually Auto refresh I'll just shut it down for now and we'll start writing the other roots for actually creating updating Etc the contexts all right so we're back here and now we'll write the root for creating the context now to do that we're going to say at app. Roots we're going to say this is going to be slash creatore contact and this time the methods that will be allowed will be post because we're going to be creating which is the post method right so now inside of here we need to write a function so we're going to say Define create under _ contact and what we need to do is we now need to get the data associated with the contact we want to create now remember I said that with request we can submit Json data so what we're going to do is look at that Json data that was submitted here and we're going to make sure that it's valid for creating our contact and let me zoom out a little bit just so it's bit easier to read some more code notice that we have this request object imported from flask so we're going to start using that we're going to say first uncore name is equal to request do Json doget and we're going to get the first name property now we're going to do the exact same thing for the last name okay so this equal to request. Json doget and then last name and then we're going to do the same thing for email which is request. json. getet and then email okay so all we're saying is okay let's look in the Json data we're going to use do get because we don't know if this key is going to exist or not and if it doesn't exist it's going to return none otherwise it's going to give us the value of the first name last name and email key now we want to make sure that all these values exist because if they don't exist then we can't make a contact so we're going to say if not first name or not last name or not email okay then we're going to return essentially an error message saying hey this didn't work so we're going to say return jsonify and we're going to put inside of here a string that says message and that says you must include a first name last name and email and then we are going to specify the response error code which is 400 standing for bad request at least I believe that's what the correct message is so again we're saying okay if you did not give us first name you did not give us last name or you did not give us an email we're going to return an error response here the way we do that is we return a Json message so we say hey here's the message so that you can read it and then we actually do a comma and we return 400 and that says what the status message of the request is now by default it's going to be 200 so here I could have just put 200 and that means success okay we don't need to put that though because that's the default if you don't include it whereas in this case we want to tell them hey this didn't work so we're manually specifying 400 okay so now if that was not the case what that means is that we did have valid first name last name and email if that is the case we need to make make a new contact add that in the database and then tell them hey this worked right this was good so we're going to say newor contact is equal to a contact and we're going to specify our values we're going to say first name is equal to first name last name is equal to last name and email is equal to email so notice that for all the fields here right other than the ID because this will be autogenerated for us first name last name and email I'm just passing those into the Constructor of my contact so now I create this new contact object that has these different fields and what I can now do is I can add it to my database now to do that I'm going to do a try and accept block so I'm going to say try db. session. add new contact then I'm going to say db. session. commit and then I'm going to say accept exception as e and then what we're going to do is say return jsonify don't worry I'll slow down here in a second we're going to say message is the string of e and then we're going to return the status code of 400 okay so let's quickly break this down when we want to add a new entry to the database we just create the python class corresponding to that entry we then add it to the database session once it's added it's kind of in the staging area so it's not yet actually been fully written to the database it's just ready to write to the database then we commit when we commit that means okay anything in the session go ahead and actually write that into the database permanently which is what commit does now the thing is errors can occur when we do this so we put it inside of a try accept blocked and in the accept block we just catch any exception and if there's an exception we simply return that as a Json message to the user telling them hey sorry you know something went wrong status code 400 great now if we get past the tri accept block what we can do is say return jsonify and we can say message and we can just do something like user created and then we can return a status code of 201 which stands for created okay it can be 200 as well but 2011 is a little bit more specific so what we're doing is saying okay well we handled all the errors if no errors occurred we're going to tell you that yes this did indeed work we're going to return to a one and now you've created a new contact so there you go that's how that works now the thing is for us to actually be able to test this it's a a little bit complicated so I'm not going to test it right now um what I'm going to do is just write the other roots and then once we have these roots you just kind of have to trust me that they work and we will test them from the front end but I don't want to get into using postmen doing all this other stuff that's going to just take us a lot of time and not really necessary for such simple Roots however usually what you would want to do is test your API before you even start working on the front end so you're going to want to ensure hey everything that I wrote here in the back end is working I'm able to create my data delete it update Etc now that I have all my data related stuff done we're going to go to the front end we're going to make it nice and pretty and we're going to interact with the backend API now in order to do that there are tools and one of the tools you can use is called Postman Postman allows you to send these more specific requests like post requests with Json data to an API especially in a development environment to test it out in our case we don't want to get into that cuz it's going to be a bit more complicated so we're just going to write the next route okay so this is create contact pause the video if you need to okay so after creating we want the ability to update however when we update we need to know what contact it is that we are updating and then we need to have some data that we're going to perform the update with so maybe we're updating the name the email we don't know so keep that in mind as I write what's going to happen next I'm going to say at app. root this is going to be SL update contact and then what I'm going to do is specify a path parameter here which indicates the exact context we want to update so I'm going to say int colon user ID now what this is doing is saying okay we need to pass to this route update contact and then a number indicating the ID of the user that it is we want to be updating so what that's going to look like if we call this is slash update contact slash1 or slash 9 or whatever the ID of the user is we want to update and then beneath that we will actually grab any of the update information and then update the contact so to do this we're going to say Define update contact we're going to take in user ID and notice that the variable name here matches whatever the path parameter is that I specified here okay now I'm going to say contact is equal to contact. query doget with user ID now what this is doing is saying okay I want to look in my contact database and I want to find the user that has this ID because in order for us to update a user it needs to exist so the first thing we're doing is looking for the user and now we're going to check if the user doesn't exist so we're going to say if not contact so if no user with that ID exists return jsonify and then we're going to say message and then this is going to be user not found like that and also this reminds me that for the root we're going to need to specify the valid methods so we're going to say methods is equal to a list and for this one uh we'll actually put patch as the method we can change it later if we want it could be post as well but patch is fine okay and for the status code we're going to go 404 actually because we're saying hey we did not find the contact now if that's not the case and we did find the contact we're going to start pursing through the Json data so we're going to say data is equal to request. Json and now we're going to get the first name last name email Etc so what we're going to do is say contact. first name is equal to data doget first name like that and then comma contact do first name now what this is doing is the following we're saying okay we're going to modify this contacts first name to be equal to whatever the Json data first name is that was given to us so if you gave us a new first name essentially we're going to use that to update the first name otherwise we're just going to leave it at whatever it was now the way the doget works is it looks for a key inside of a dictionary which is what this will be if the key exists it returns to us that value if it doesn't exist it instead returns whatever the second parameter is inside or the second argument is sorry inside of the get function so in this case if first name exists gives us a first name if it doesn't we just keep whatever the first name was for the contact now we're going to do the same thing for the last name we're going to say this equal to data. getet last name and then contact. last name and then you guess that we're going to do the same thing for the email so contact. email is equal to data doget email and then contact email so this way whatever it is that they pass here is what we're going to update so if they give us a new first name we update just the first name if they give us first name and a last name we update those it handles any possible combination of the different data they could be passing us because they may only update one field they may not update all of them right which is what we're kind of checking now what we've done is we've modified the contact what we can simply do is db. session. commit and since this contact already existed it's already added in the session so when we commit the session it makes that change permanently we then can say return jsonify like this and we can pass again a message and the message can say user updated like that and then we can just return 2011 for success I believe there's another exact uh status code we could use but I think 200 is totally fine okay so that's it for updating creating and getting last thing we need to do is handling deleting so let's do that and then the API will be finished and we can go over to the front end which is where we'll actually see the interact ability here in our application okay so let's write another rout we're going to say at app. root and this is going to be SL delete contact and same thing we're going to specify a path parameter here for the ID of the contact we want to to leave this will just be user ID now for the methods we'll say methods are equal to a list and this time it's going to be the delete method okay now we're going to Define our function we're going to say delete contact and then this is going to be user uncore ID and similarly to before we're just going to copy this exact code which is going to give us this contact so we're going to paste that in we're going to say okay let's look for the contact with the user ID if it doesn't exist we're going to return 404 otherwise we'll simply delete it and deleting it is quite easy we're going to say db. session. delete and we're going to delete delete this contact and then db. session do commit and then again return and this is going to be jsonify of a message and the message is going to say user deleted okay and then status 200 okay that's it that finishes our API so if you need to pause the video finish coding this out of course you can also reference the code from the link in the description we can quickly run through it we have the ability to get where we query all the contacts we just convert them into Json and return them we have the ability to create this is a post request we get all of the Json data we make sure that we do actually have a first name last name email then we create the new contact add it into the session and then tell them hey this was created for updating we need to know the contact we're updating so we get the contacts ID we use that to get the specific contact we then update the data did not mean to do that and then same thing for delete we get the contact we delete it and we return our success message so what I want to do now is I want to move over to the front end we're going to start coding this out and we're going to see how to interact with this back end all right so I've just expanded the folder here for front end and we're going to start just cleaning this up a little bit and then we'll start writing a few different components that we need now it's not a ton of code but what we want to do is be able to interact with the back end by pressing buttons using input Fields Etc so what I like to do right away is go to source and just start deleting a few things that we don't need so for example in assets we can just delete this folder we don't need that I want to go to main. jsx actually this looks good we're going to go to app.jsx and we're going to remove the import of the v logo and the assets here we're then just going to delete everything inside of here except for this fragment and we'll get rid of that okay so that's what we want for app now for public we can delete this logo we don't need that and we can go to our index.html and we can remove the reference to the logo and then for the title we can change this to contact list okay so that's kind of all we need what I want to do to begin is just fetch the contacts that we have now by default we're not going to have any but I just want to show you how it works in terms of sending that request and then we'll display all of those and then add the form for creating contact updating deleting Etc so what we'll actually do is from our backend notice I'm my back end here we'll just run this so Python 3 main.py just so that that's going so we can actually test that in a second and then from App we're going to set up some state which is going to store our contacts so we're going to say constant and then inside of a set of square brackets contacts and set contacts is equal to use state and this is going to be an empty list because that's what we're going to have for the context then we're going to make a function we're going to say const fetch contacts is equal to an arrow function here and react this is actually going to be an asynchronous function because it's going to need to wait a second to fetch the contacts and what we're going to do is send a request to the backend to get the context how do we do that well we say const response is equal to await and then we're going to use fetch fetch is something you can use to send a request by default it will send a get request which is the type that we want to send and we're going to send to http colon SL slash make sure you have the HTTP by the way otherwise it's not going to work and then 127.0.0.1 Port 5000 which is what our flask server is running on SLC context all we're doing is sending a get request to the SL contacts endpoint now we're waiting for this to give us a response once it gives us a response we want to get the Json data associated with the response so we can say cons data is equal to await response. Json that's going to give us the Json and then we can say set context and this is going to be data. context okay because what's going to happen is it's going to return the Json remember the Json that we return looks like contacts and then contains a list so so we grab the context property that gives us this value right here which is all of our context we then set that in the state so for now if we want to see what this is we can just say console.log data. contacts and now we would just want to call this whenever this component renders we just want to call it once as soon as we load the website essentially so to do that we're going to import use effect and we're going to put a use effect hookup here we're going to say use effect okay we're going to pass an arrow function then inside of this function we're going to call the fetch contacts function okay so all we're doing is saying okay as soon as this component renders as soon as it loads call this function and then here we call this it's going to give us the contacts and set it in the state and then we can use that to list all the contacts out again right now we're not really going to see anything because we don't actually have any contacts it's going to be an empty list but this will at least allow us to test that we're able to send the request to our backend and I'll show you how we do that so here you go on this side of the screen we have our what is this server our API I'm going to split my terminal and I'm going to CD into the front end directory I'm going to clear and to run my code we type npm run Dev make sure you're in the front end directory for that it's going to spin up the front end server for us and you can see that this is running on Port 5173 maybe different for you I'm going to press on control on my keyboard or command if you're on Mac and press press on that and it's going to open up the browser let me just put this in a new window now if we refresh we should see that every time we refresh we get a new get request happening in our backend server over here so just you can test that and you can see that it's sending the request and if we right click here and go on inspect we should see in the console that we're getting an array with zero elements right so every time I refresh we get that again so we get this kind of empty array uh because well that that's what's happening right we're fetching the contexts and none of them exist so it's giving us an empty array okay so that's that and I think that's it for right now in terms of fetching we can leave these running for now what we want to do next is we want to actually display all of the different contexts that we have I'll show you how we can mock some data by the way so we can actually view if it's working and then we want to create a form that allows us to create a new contact so what I'm going to do is make a new component in this Source folder here and I'm going to call this my contact list jsx now this is where we will write the uh what do you call component for rendering our context so I'm going to say import react from react and we're going to make a new component to do that we're going to say const contact list is equal to a function and inside of this function we're going to take a prop and this prop is going to be contacts because we need to have all the context that we can render them so we're going to accept that and then what we're going to do is start writing out some basic HTML this is something you've probably seen before it's going to be very straightforward that will just render our context in a table so that we can view all of them so we're going to return a div we're going to have a header so we're going to say header two contexts and now we're going to create a table so we'll make a table in HTML to start we're going to define the head of the table and then beneath that we can Define the body of the table by the way if you just want to copy this out again you you can do from the link in the description in the head we need a table Row in the row we need our table headers which are th first one is going to be first name the second one is going to be last name we need another one so table head this is going to be email and then one more is going to be actions because we're going to have actions like updating and deleting uh the different entries so there you go that's it for the head now we want to do the body now this is going to be dynamically rendered because it's going to be based on all the contacts that we actually have so inside the body we're going to put a set of braces here and we're going to say contacts. map and we're going to map with a function here all of the contexts that we have and we're going to return a new row for them so we're actually going to do a set of parentheses and we're going to say t R and then here we're going to pass a key whenever you have Dynamic data you need a key so for the key this is just going to be the contact. and then inside of the table row we're going to have table data for all of the different entries we want to show so we're going to have the contact DOT first name if we could spell that correctly we're going to do the same thing for the contact do last name and then we need the email so we're going to have contact. email and then we need the buttons so we're going to have table data and then inside of here we're going to have two buttons so we're just going to say button first one we'll say update and the second one we'll say delete okay so that should be it this again dynamically rendering all the different table rows for our different contexts pretty straightforward JavaScript and react here we have our table data which contains first row last row or last name sorry first name last name apologies email and then we have our buttons update and delete we'll hook those up with some functions in a second but for now what we'll do is we'll actually render this component from app.jsx so we need to export the contact list I just remembered so we're going to go down here and say export default contact list needs to be exported for us to be able to import it we're going to go to app.jsx and we're going to import it so we're going to say import the contact list from do/ contact list and now we're just going to render the contact list so for return we can just say contact list and then contacts can be equal to contacts like that now right now we're not going to see anything because we don't actually have any contacts however if we go to our web page so let me open this up here oh looks like I closed it so let's rerun it okay let's open this again boom you you see that we get contacts first name last name email actions now it's not very spread out we can obviously change the styling if we want but now what we can do if we want to test a contact is we can simply go here we can comment this out and we can just set a mock contact which is what I'm going to do so I'm going to say first name Tim last name spell that correctly my last name let me just save this I'm going to say email let's go email and then ID of one and I actually realized I don't need to have a string for all of these but that's fine so now I'm just setting like a mock contact so we can test this and let's move this over so we can read it and now if we go back here you can see we get first name last name email actions Tim Vera email update and delete obviously it doesn't look very pretty we can fix the styling later on and in fact if we want to just make it look a bit more plain we can go to app.css and we can just remove all this so if I grab that and just remove it if we go back here we kind of get moved over here and then if we go to index.css same thing if we remove all of that now we get kind of the original HTML now if we want to just space these out a little bit we can do that a bit easier so inside of index.css or app.js app.css doesn't matter which one you do we could say dot T head and we can just say the margin is something like 10 pixels and now if we go back here uh actually we're not getting any spacing there H maybe we want to do it ah it's cuz I haveth we just want th like that now if I refresh okay sorry about the cut there but now that is finished in terms of viewing our contacts what we're going to do now is we're going to make a component that allows us to create some contact so let's remove this mock contact cuz we don't need this anymore and we're going to make a new one here and we're going to call this the contact form. jsx okay so inside of contact form uh we're going to well create a form so we're going to say import and this is going to be U state from react we're then I'm going to make a function and we're going to say actually we could do it the other way the way we did it before we'll say const and this will be contact form equals an arrow function inside of here we're going to take two s uh and actually we won't write them yet cuz I don't want to confuse you we'll write them afterwards anyways inside this function we need some state for our form so we're going to need to store the first name last name and email and then we're going to use that and actually submit that to the API to create a new contact so we're going to say const first name and then set first name is equal to use State and empty string we're then going to say const last name set last name for some reason my shift key is bit sticky here not really working that well we'll say use State and then const email set email is equal to use State and this will be an empty string okay so that's it in terms of the different content we're going to want to store next we're going to return the form so we're going to say return and we'll actually return a form now inside of the form here we're going to have a div now inside of this div we're going to have uh our first kind of label our first input element which is going to be for our first name so we're going to say label this is going to be HTML 4 is equal to the first name inside the label we're just going to say first name colon like that we're then going to have an input tag and for the input tag this is going to be type is equal to text we're going to have the ID equal to the first name we're going to have the value equal to the first name and we're going to have on change is equal to and then this is going to be a function which is e and then set first name and then e. target. value and let's see if we can format that okay for some reason the formatter doesn't seem to want to be working so it's a bit difficult to read uh let me see if I can get that working all right so there we go I got the format working so now we're actually able to read this okay so anyways we have our onchange which is again a function e set first name e. target. value now we're going to copy this exact same thing and we're going to paste it twice one for the last name and one for the email so we're just going to change these manually to say last name this is going to be last name last name and this will be set the last name and then we want email so we'll make this email and rather than that just say email email email and set email okay so now we have a basic form that's first name last name and email we just want a button now that we can press on uh that will actually create this element so we're just going to say button and this is going to say create contact and and then for the type we'll say type is equal to submit and now we want what we want to do is create a function story so that when we actually press on this button it does something and it creates this content and what I also want to do is export this I'm going to say export default and then contact form like that okay so what we'll do is make a function now so we're going to say const on submit is equal to this and inside of our form we're going to set this up so we're going to say onsubmit is equal to onsubmit so essentially that means once we press this button we're going to go into this function naming this function we're going to say e. prefent default and we're going to take in E that just means we're not going to refresh the page automatically which we don't want to do so that's kind of removing that standard behavior and now we're going to set up a post request so that we can actually create the um the contact I also realize this needs to be called set last name not sure how I made that set last time okay so first thing we're going to do is start defining the data that we actually want to pass with our Json as the request so we're going to say con data is equal to an object and we're just going to pass in the first name the last name and the email which corresponds with what we're looking for in the API when we create a new contact we then are going to specify the URL so we're going to say const URL is equal to HT TTP col1 127.0.0.1 colon 5000 SLC creatore contact okay so that's the URL or the route that we want to go to now that we have this we're going to set up some options for our requests so we're going to say con options is equal to first thing we're going to do is specify the method in this case the method is post when you are not doing a get request you need to actually manually specify all the different options whereas with a get request it just automatically does it for you so that's what we're writing here we're going to pass something known as a header so we're going to say headers this is going to be an object again and we're going to say the content-type is equal to application SL Json now what we're pretty much specifying here is that we're about to submit Json data so we need to include that in a header when we send this request that the API knows that we actually have Json data we're then going to say body is co and equal to Json and all capitals do stringify and we're going to stringify this data might seem a bit weird what we're doing this but essentially this is a JavaScript object just like in Python we need to convert this into a valid Json object so what we do is we take json. stringify that converts it into a Json string which we then include in the body of our request now what we need to do is actually send the request so we're going to say const response is equal to await and we're going to say fetch the URL and we're going to fetch this with the options that we specified and since we're using async here we need to put async for our function uh on the onsubmit so we're going to do that so say con response equal to A8 fetch URL options we then are going to check if this was successful so we're going to say if the response. status does not equal to a one or the in actually sorry not or we're going to say and the response. status does not equal 200 so essentially we're just checking hey if you did not give us a valid response if it wasn't 200 or it wasn't to A1 then what we want to do is we want to alert the user that there was an error so we're going to say con message is equal to await response. Json and then we're going to say alert and we're going to alert the message do message because what happens is inside of the Json which actually we could just call data to make this a bit more clear we have a key called message that contains the error message so we're just going to alert the user of that otherwise we can say that this was successful and eventually in a second we will do something here now this actually completes this form let me zoom out a little bit so we can read it better we have the state for all of the three variables that we need we have our onsubmit might seem a bit confusing but really it's it's not overly complex we're just defining the data defining the URL endpoint setting the options for the request sending the request checking if it was successful if it wasn't we're going to alert them with an error otherwise we'll kind of indicate it was successful but we're not going to do that this second okay so that's about it here for the contact form now we need to actually render the contact form so to do that we're going to go to app.jsx and we're just going to make a fragment here and we're going to take this and place it inside of the fragment and then beneath it we're going to render the contact form like that now let me just actually format this so that it looks a little bit nicer and there we go and now we'll remove the comment on fetch contacts and now we should have a form that will allow us to uh create a new contact so we can test that out and we should have the ability to get that contact once it is created so let's go back here you you can see that we have our form again a little bit messy but we can clean that up in a second for the first name let's go with Tim last name here we're going to go Tim atgmailcom let's click on create now notice we don't get any output the reason we're not seeing anything is because we haven't forc refresh the screen however if we refresh here you'll see that now we actually get this contact appearing and if we go back to vs code and we look here you can see that we had a post request come in right where it created the new contact and returned the status of 2011 now let's see what happens if we press this and um you know we don't have any values it says You must include a first name a last name and email if we just do Tim same thing we're going to get that error there right and if we try to repeat the same email we should actually get an error as well it says here there's some error that occurred here unique constraint failed on contact. email essentially meaning that the email is not unique right and as we said we need it to be unique okay so that's it for the form now we'll make it look a little bit nicer in a second but you can see that we're getting all those error messages in our API and while we are successfully calling the API and creating new contacts okay so now we know how to create new contacts and fetch them what we want to do now is be able to delete them and to update them we also just want to prettify the form a little bit and what I want to do is I want to make it so that if we go back here we only see this form if we press uh create or update so the idea is we can reuse the same form for updating and for creating because it's going to be the exact same information so what I want to do is make it so that we pop this up into modal modal is just something that's kind of hovering on top of the screen it's like a little window that pops up so we're going to implement that modal functionality so that this form is only visible when we're creating or updating and then we'll reuse it or kind of modify it to be able to update the contact as well okay so setting this up is a little bit complex but it's okay we can handle it so let's go to app.jsx and let's start kind of handling this modal component so we're going to say const is modal open and then set is modal open is equal to use State and then false so what we'll do is we'll set this state to True when we want to actually open the model now we need some functions that will allow us to toggle the model so we're going to say cont and this is going to be I'll actually start with close model is equal to this and we'll just say set is modal open to false we'll then have const open and the thing is though this model can be opened in two ways so it can be opened when we're creating a new contact or when we're editing a contact so I'm going to say open create model okay what this is going to do is it simp simply going to say if not is modal open then we're going to say set is modal open to true so if it's not already open then we will go ahead and open it and now that I think of it actually yeah that's good that's what we'll do so if it's not open then we'll open it up okay now we need something that will display the model so let's go down here and let's write this out we're going to have a block here and we're going to say is modal open and if that's the case we're going to render a div now inside of this div we're going to have a class name so this is going to be equal to modal we're going to use a little bit of CSS in a second here we're then going to have another div this is going to have a class name equal to modal Das content and then inside here we're going to have a close button and we're going to have our contact form so we're going to take the contact form and paste it inside of here and then above this we're going to have a span we're going to have class name is equal to close and we're going to have on click this is equal to close the modal and then inside of here we're going to put the ENT times and then a semicolon which is just the x button okay that's what we're kind of representing here okay so now we have what we need for the model we can test this I believe actually however we don't have a way yet to open it so so let's make a button and we're going to say button and this is going to say create new contact and for the button we're going to have onclick equal to the open create model okay so we'll see if this works or not for now we should if we refresh here when we click create new contact you see it opens up and when I click the x button it closes however I want it to kind of appear a little bit nicer than that so we'll write some CSS so that it's styled but you can see it is opening and closing so that's working at least okay so let's go to app.css and let's start writing some of this CSS so we're going to say modal let's zoom in a bit here we're going to say it has a position which is fixed by the way you can of course copy this from the link in the description we're going to give it a z index of one meaning it will appear on the top of the screen we're going to give it a left of zero and a right of zero okay setting its position we're going to say the width is equal to 100% the height is equal to 100% we're going to say overflow Auto and then we're going to say the background color is equal to the following this is going to be rgba and we're going to have 0 0 0 and then 0.4 opacity that's going to give us a nice gray color okay then we're going to have dot modal content and for the modal content we're going to have a background color and the background color can be pound Fe Fe Fe like that okay we're going to have a margin for the margin it's going to be 10% and then Auto we're going to have some padding this is going to be 20 pixels we're going to have a border around the content and this is going to be a one pixel solid border and the color of it is going to be a 888 okay so you can kind of see the the preview right there we're then going to have a width of 80% okay so let's add our semicolon here so that doesn't give us an error okay almost done we're now going to have a close so the close is going to be the close button right so we're going to say color is equal to pound a a a like that we're going to say float to the right so this just means hey put this to the right side of the content we're then going to say the font size is equal to 28 pixels this will Define the size and the font weight is Boldt okay so that's it for our styles again you can just copy them from the link in the description if you don't want to type them out now if we go back here we refresh and we click on this now that's not quite how I wanted it to appear um give me a sec here guys I'm going to look at what's wrong and then I'll come back and we can fix this up okay looks like I'm missing a comma here inside of my rgba color so that might have been the error let's see if we do this now okay no it's still giving us an issue so give me a second aha so I see here in my modal I have a position of left zero right zero I actually wanted left zero top zero so let's try this now and that's better that's what I wanted so now you can see that what it's doing is kind of filling the whole screen with this opacity uh and then it's showing me the modal here and I can close it by clicking the x button and now what we can do is just add a bit of space spacing between our fields and then that'll be kind of done for the styling and we can hook up updating and deleting so let's go to index.css and inside here I'm just going to do a general Style on all my input tags where I say they have a margin top of 10 pixels I'm then going to do the same for my button and my label so I'll say input comma button comma label I just want all of them to have a slight margin so now you'll see when I click on this there's a little bit of margin and it looks a bit nicer okay now that we've got that finished let's go and make it so we are able to actually edit these contacts all right so to be able to actually edit these contacts what we pretty much need to know is what contact it is that we're editing which means from our contact list here when we press on this update button we kind of need to go back into the app.jsx component and we need to indicate what that contact actually was and then open the modal using that context so there's a few changes here and these components are going to be intertwined what we'll need to do is in the contact list we're going to have to have a a button be pressed that button is going to tell the main app component hey we want to edit a contact it's then going to open up a modal and we're then going to need to pass that contact to the contact form and then the form will allow us to edit that contact so what that means is we'll start with the form and inside contact form we're going to take in some props so we're going to say that my existing contact is equal to an empty object and then we're going to take in an update call back which is a function we're going to call as soon as we perform any updates now what we're going to do is for our first name last name and email is we're going to use the existing contacts first name last name or email if it exists so we're going to say existing contact DOT first name by the way sorry if you guys can hear those Sirens here it's it's quite loud but we're going to keep going we'll say existing contact last name and we'll say existing contact. email or an empty string so what this is pretty much doing is saying okay let's look at the existing contact if we have one meaning we're actually editing a contact we'll put in what their first name last name and email is otherwise we'll just have an empty string that's all that's doing now at the same time I also need to know here whether or not I'm updating or creating a new contact because we'll have to change what we're doing inside of here based on if it's an update or if it's a create so we're going to say const updating okay if we can spell this correctly is equal to object. entries of the existing contact. length does not equal zero now what this tells us is okay if you passed us an object that has at least one entry inside of it that means that we're updating it because we actually have some existing data if it doesn't that means we're creating a new contact so that's kind of how we know here uh with with updating okay so now what we'll do is we'll change a few things based on if we're updating or if we're creating so really the only change that we actually need to handle is just in the URL here because whether we're updating or we are creating we're going to be submitting the same data which is whatever is in this form so what we'll do is we'll go to the URL here we'll remove the create contact and we're going to append to this some Dynamic data which is going to be the end point so we're going to say if we're updating question mark then we're going to put some back ticks which are just where the Tilda key is on your keyboard usually beneath the Escape key and we're going to say well if we're updating then we're going to call the update contact but we need to pass to this the ID of the contact we're updating so we're going to pass in a dollar sign in our braces allowing us to embed a variable and we're going to say that this is the existing contact. ID cuz if we have an existing contact if we're updating well this is the one that we're updating so we're calling update contact with that as the path parameter otherwise we just put create contact like that and that's pretty much it so it just changes the URL based on if we're updating or creating to be either update or create nice then when we have the else here we're just going to call the update call back and what this update call back will do is just tell uh the app.jsx component hey we actually finished this we didn't update or create operation and that will then close the model for us uh and allow us to update the data that we see from uh what do you call it the contact list okay so we have the contact form and the thing is we need to pass to this the existing contact if we are um what do you call it updating right so how do we do that well we need to actually go to contact list and from contact list we need to take in some functions as well that we can call if we want to update a contact so I'm going to say update contact and update callback now the idea is whenever we perform an update we'll call the update call back and whenever we want to update a contact we'll just call this function with the contact we want to update so what we'll do is we'll go to the update button here and we'll say on this click so on click is equal to and this is going to be a function and this function is going to call the update contact and it's going to pass the contact okay so we're saying okay if you click on click we're going to have a little function here Arrow function that will call update contact with the contact that we want to update so now when we press that what will happen is if we go back to app.jsx here we want to make it so that that update contact call opens the modal that then allows us to update the contact so for our contact form here we need to pass in something what is it that we wanted to pass let's remember here we need the existing contact and the update call back okay so let's actually do that after we do the contact list so we're going to make a new function here we're going to say open edit model okay now for the open edit model what we want to do here is open the model with our contact so we're going to say contact like that and what this is going to do is say if the modal is open simply return otherwise we're going to actually set some new state so we're going to make some new state here we're going to say const and this is going to be the contact it's actually going to be the current contact and then Set current contact is equal to use State and this will be an empty object and the idea is this will store the Conta that we're currently editing so if we go here to this function we're going to say Set current contact to be equal to this contact and then we're going to open the modal so we're going to say set is modal to be equal to True okay so if you say open edit modal so if we call this function we're going to check if it's open if it is we're just going to return otherwise we're going to set the current contact and then we're going to open the model so we're going to say on uh what is this actually it's going to say update contact is going to be equal to and we're going to pass it the open edit modal function like this and then in the contact form here we're going to say the existing contact is equal to the current contact okay we're now going to do one more thing when we close the model we're going to say Set current contact to be equal to an empty object because as soon as we close it now we're kind of resetting it right so we have open the create model which does this open the edit model and then we have Clos modal now we need one more function which is what's happening when we actually perform an update so we're going to say const on update on update what we're going to do here is we're going to close the model which will do all this and then we're going to fetch the contacts again because they could have been updated after the on update so now for our contact list we're going to have the update call back which is equal to on update and we need the same thing for our contact form okay so we have update call back okay I think that this is good for now I know this is a little confusing but let's test it and then we can move forward so we're going to go create new contact you see it opens up the modal and when I click on edit you see it opens the modal but this time it passes in our contact information now the only thing is that this says create contact when really we want it to say edit contact so let's go change that we're going to go to contact form going to scroll down to where it says create contact and again we can just do some Dynamic rendering so we can say editing uh or what is this updating question mark then we'll say update otherwise we'll say create okay so we can test this again if we go create new contact shows us create if we go update shows us update let's try like Tim two when I click on update okay uh I guess maybe we're getting an error because that didn't do what I was expecting it to do so let's go inspect console and it says syntax error is not valid Json okay server responded with a status of 405 method not allowed so I suppose we're just submitting the wrong request type so let's have a look at this we can go here and notice that we get a post which is not valid okay so I believe that's cuz we used a patch so let's go back to our contact form and there's one more thing we need to change here which which is the method so we're going to say updating question mark then we're going to call the patch method method otherwise it's post so my apologies there guys but the method was not allowed so you actually saw here right it said hey responded with 405 method not allowed because we tried to send a post request when really we need to send a patch request so let's call update again let's change this to tim2 update and now notice it worked this time and it actually changed our email to be Tim 2@gmail.com we can create a new contact let's go Jeff uh Dean okay J gmail.com create and then notice it shows up here the only thing we need to handle is the delete if we call update you can see we can update this to be Jeff 2 and that works completely fine okay so let's handle the delete and then we will be close to finished so let's go back here to our contact list and we need an on delete function so we're going to say const on delete now for delete we just need the ID of the user that we want to delete so we're just going to say ID like that and now we need to send a request that allows us to delete the user so what we'll do is the following we will say try and we're going to say const response is equal to await fetch which tells me I need to make this an async function so let's go ahead and do that and we're going to await the following http colon1 127.0.0.1 delore contact and we're going to change these to back ticks so we can embed a variable in here and the variable we're going to have is going to be slash and then the dollar sign the braces and the ID of the user we want to delete now we need some options for this so we're going to say const options are equal to and in this case all we need to do is specify the method so we're going to say method is equal to delete we don't need to do the application type Json we don't need to have all that Json data because all we're doing is just calling this with the delete method so that means we're going to pass options here that's now going to send that delete request now what we need to do is we need to again check the status and see what happens so we're going to say if the response. status is equal to 200 that means it was successful so we're going to call the update call back otherwise there was an error so we're going to say console. error like this console error if we can spell that and we're going to say failed to delete and then we're going to have a catch block here and we're going to catch the error and we're going to say console. error and actually we can just alert the error so we're going to say alert and then we'll just alert whatever the error actually is okay so I think that should be good let me quickly run through this cuz I know it went a little bit fast there we have a try and a catch just because we could potentially get an error when we try to delete the contact we set the options equal to Method delete we send the request this time it's going to be this URL with options we're using the ID of the contact we then check if it was successful which needs to be if response. status is equal to 200 not two if it was successful we call the update call back that's going to tell our app.jsx here that we should close the modal and then fetch the contacts again because now we've deleted one right and then what we do if we have an error is we say failed to delete or we catch it and we alert okay so that's it now we just need to call this function so we're going to have on click is equal to again a function and we're going to say on delete and we're going to pass the contact. ID okay we can test this out now so let's go here refresh and click on delete and it says failed to fetch uh connection refused okay I potentially just typed something wrong here so let's see looks like I forgot my port 5000 so let's add 5,000 in there go back and delete and now notice that it works and I can update okay Tim two create new contact Jeff do J.O gmail.com and create and you see that we create the contact all of this going through our backend API you can see the post request get request and the patch request of course and the delete request as well okay so I think guys with that said that is going to wrap up this video as I said I know it's not the most complicated project in the world but I think this Illustrated to you how we architect out the front end and the back end the order in which we go about doing things how we communicate between a front end and a back end the different HTTP requests we can set and what it's like actually treating the back end is kind of a separate system that has all of the data and has that protocol that we can then use from the front end keep in mind now we can use this data anywhere we want in any type of application doesn't need to be the react app which is the whole benefit of having a separate backend now it's very flexible to go and create different front ends different interfaces and different ways to communicate with the backend API so I will wrap it up here if you enjoyed leave a like subscribe to the channel and I will see you in the next [Music] one w\", metadata={'source': 'PppslXOR7TA', 'title': 'Python + JavaScript - Full Stack App Tutorial', 'description': 'Unknown', 'view_count': 72580, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PppslXOR7TA/hq720.jpg', 'publish_date': '2024-02-19 00:00:00', 'length': 5364, 'author': 'Tech With Tim'})]\"\n",
